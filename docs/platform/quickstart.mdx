### 4.1 Create Memories

You can create long-term and short-term memories for your users, AI Agents, etc. Here are some examples:

#### Long-term memory for a user

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a vegetarian and I'm allergic to nuts."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! I've noted that you're a vegetarian and have a nut allergy. I'll keep this in mind for any food-related recommendations or discussions."}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a vegetarian and I'm allergic to nuts."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! I've noted that you're a vegetarian and have a nut allergy. I'll keep this in mind for any food-related recommendations or discussions."}
];
client.add(messages, { user_id: "alex" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/" \
     -H "Authorization: Token your-api-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "messages": [
             {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a vegetarian and I'm allergic to nuts."},
             {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! I've noted that you're a vegetarian and have a nut allergy. I'll keep this in mind for any food-related recommendations or discussions."}
         ],
         "user_id": "alex"
     }'
```

```json Output
{'message': 'ok'}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Short-term memory for a user session

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning a trip to Japan next month."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's exciting, Alex! A trip to Japan next month sounds wonderful. Would you like some recommendations for vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Japan?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please! Especially in Tokyo."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! I'll remember that you're interested in vegetarian restaurants in Tokyo for your upcoming trip. I'll prepare a list for you in our next interaction."}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex123", session_id="trip-planning-2024")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning a trip to Japan next month."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's exciting, Alex! A trip to Japan next month sounds wonderful. Would you like some recommendations for vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Japan?"},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! I'll remember that you're interested in vegetarian restaurants in Tokyo for your upcoming trip. I'll prepare a list for you in our next interaction."}
];
client.add(messages, { user_id: "alex123", session_id: "trip-planning-2024" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/" \
     -H "Authorization: Token your-api-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "messages": [
             {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning a trip to Japan next month."},
             {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's exciting, Alex! A trip to Japan next month sounds wonderful. Would you like some recommendations for vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Japan?"},

         "user_id": "alex123",
         "session_id": "trip-planning-2024"
     }'
```

```json Output
{'message': 'ok'}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Long-term memory for agents

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a personalized travel assistant. Remember user preferences and provide tailored recommendations."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood. I'll maintain personalized travel preferences for each user and provide customized recommendations based on their dietary restrictions, interests, and past interactions."}
]
client.add(messages, agent_id="travel-assistant")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a personalized travel assistant. Remember user preferences and provide tailored recommendations."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood. I'll maintain personalized travel preferences for each user and provide customized recommendations based on their dietary restrictions, interests, and past interactions."}
];
client.add(messages, { agent_id: "travel-assistant" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/" \
     -H "Authorization: Token your-api-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

```

```json Output
{'message': 'Memory deleted successfully'}
```
</CodeGroup>

Delete all memories of a user:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.delete_all(user_id="alex")
```

```javascript JavaScript
client.deleteAll({ user_id: "alex" })
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/?user_id=alex" \

```
</CodeGroup>

Fun fact: You can also delete the memory using the `add()` method by passing a natural language command:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.add("Delete all of my food preferences", user_id="alex")
```

```javascript JavaScript
client.add("Delete all of my food preferences", { user_id: "alex" })
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/" \
     -H "Authorization: Token your-api-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Delete all of my food preferences"}],
