</Tip>

## Welcome to Mem0 Platform

**Mem0 Platform is a fully managed memory layer for AI agents.** Add persistent, personalized memory to your AI applications in minutes - no infrastructure setup required.

## What is Mem0?

Mem0 is a memory layer that enables your AI applications to remember user preferences, conversation history, and contextual information across sessions. Instead of treating every interaction as isolated, Mem0 allows your AI to build on previous conversations and adapt to individual users over time.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Without Mem0, every AI conversation starts from scratch:
- User preferences disappear between sessions
- Previous context is lost and must be re-explained
- Personalization becomes impossible
- AI can't learn or adapt to individual users

With Mem0, your AI remembers:
- Context persists across sessions with sub-50ms latency
- Preferences are automatically recalled
- Responses adapt to each user's history
- No infrastructure setup or vector DB management required

## Where Can I Use Mem0?

Mem0 powers memory for diverse AI applications. Explore real-world implementations:

- **[Customer Support Agents](/examples/customer-support-agent)** - Remember customer history and preferences
- **[AI Tutors](/examples/personal-ai-tutor)** - Track learning progress and adapt lessons
- **[Travel Assistants](/examples/personal-travel-assistant)** - Recall travel preferences and past trips
- **[Content Writing](/examples/memory-guided-content-writing)** - Maintain consistent voice and context
