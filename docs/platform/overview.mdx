# Mem0 Platform Overview

Mem0 is the memory engine that keeps conversations contextual so users never repeat themselves and your agents respond with continuity. Mem0 Platform delivers that experience as a fully managed service—scaling, securing, and enriching memories without any infrastructure work on your side.

<Tip>
  Mem0 v1.0.0 shipped rerankers, async-by-default behavior, and Azure OpenAI support. Catch the full list of changes in the <Link href="/changelog">release notes</Link>.
</Tip>

## Why it matters

- **Personalized replies**: Memories persist across users and agents, cutting prompt bloat and repeat questions.
- **Hosted stack**: Mem0 runs the vector store, graph services, and rerankers—no provisioning, tuning, or maintenance.
- **Enterprise controls**: SOC 2, audit logs, and workspace governance ship by default for production readiness.
