# Cookbook Template

Cookbooks are narrative tutorials. They start with a real problem, show the broken path, then layer production-ready fixes. Use this template verbatim so every contributor (human or LLM) ships the same experience.

---

## ❌ DO NOT COPY — Guidance & Constraints
- Tell a story: problem → broken demo → iterative fixes → production patterns.
- Keep tone conversational; use real names ("Max", "Sarah"), not `user_123`.
- Opening must stay tight: ≤2 short paragraphs (no bullet lists) before the first section.
- Inline expected outputs immediately after each code block.
- When modernizing an existing cookbook, keep the narrative beats, screenshots, and sample outputs—reshape them into this arc instead of rewriting unless the workflow changed.
- Limit callouts to 3–5 per page. Prefer narrative text over stacked boxes.
- Always provide Python **and** TypeScript tabs when an SDK exists for both.
- Every page must end with exactly two navigation cards (left = related/side quest, right = next cookbook in the journey).

---

## ✅ COPY THIS — Content Skeleton
Paste the block below into a new cookbook, then replace all placeholders. Remove any section you don't need **only after** the happy path works.

title: [Cookbook title — action oriented]
description: [1 sentence outcome]

# [Hero headline]

[Two sentences max: state the user's pain and what this cookbook will fix.]

<Tip>
[Only include if you truly have launch news. Delete otherwise to keep the intro crisp.]
</Tip>

<Info icon="clock">
**Time to complete:** [~X minutes] · **Languages:** Python, TypeScript
</Info>

## Setup

```python
default_language = "python"  # replace with real imports
```
```typescript
// Equivalent TypeScript setup goes here
```

<Note>
Mention any prerequisites (API keys, environment variables) right here if the reader must do something before running code.
</Note>

## Make It Work Once

[Set context with characters + goal.]

```python
# Happy-path example
```
```typescript
// Happy-path example (TypeScript)
```

<Info icon="check">
Expected output (Python): `[describe inline]`  ·  Expected output (TypeScript): `[describe inline]`
</Info>

## The Problem

[Explain what breaks without tuning.]

```python
# Broken behaviour
```
```typescript
// Broken behaviour
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste noisy output]
```

[One sentence on why the result is unacceptable.]

## Fix It – [Solution Name]

[Explain the fix and why it helps.]

```python
# Improved implementation
```
```typescript
// Improved implementation
```

**Retest:**
```python
# Same test as before
```
```typescript
// Same test as before
```

**Output:**
```
[Cleaner result]
```

[Highlight the improvement + remaining gap if any.]

## Build On It – [Second Layer]

[Add another enhancement, e.g., metadata filters, rerankers, batching.]

```python
# Additional refinement
```
```typescript
// Additional refinement
```

<Warning>
Call out the most common mistake or edge case for this layer.
</Warning>

## ✅ Publish Checklist (Keep Handy)
- [ ] Replace every `[placeholder]` and remove unused sections.
- [ ] Python & TypeScript code compile (or TypeScript omitted with explicit `<Note>` stating language limitation).
- [ ] Each code block is followed by output + `<Info icon="check">` or inline equivalent.
- [ ] Callouts ≤ 5 total; no emoji, only Mintlify icons.
- [ ] Exactly two cards in the final `<CardGroup cols={2}>`.
- [ ] Added verification narrative (what success looks like) in every major step.
- [ ] Linked related docs (cookbooks, guides, reference) in Next Steps.

Stick to the skeleton above. If you need to deviate, document the rationale in the PR so we can update the template for everyone else.
