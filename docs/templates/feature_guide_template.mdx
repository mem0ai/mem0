# Feature Guide Template

Use this when you introduce or deepen a single Mem0 capability (Graph Memory, Advanced Retrieval, etc.). Aim for crisp problem framing, a walkthrough of how the feature works, and practical configuration guidance with clear exits.

## Reader Promise
- Understand the pain the feature solves and when to reach for it.
- See how to enable, configure, and observe the feature in action.
- Know the next conceptual deep dive and a hands-on example to try.

## Start → Middle → End Pattern

### 1. **Start – Why this feature exists**
- Frontmatter stays outcome-driven: `title`, `description`, `icon`, optional `badge` (e.g., “Advanced”).
- Opening paragraph = two sentences: problem, then payoff. Keep energy high right from the start.
- Include an `<Info>` block titled “You’ll use this when…” with 3 bullets (user persona, workload, expected benefit).
- When reshaping legacy feature docs, carry over existing diagrams, tables, and gotchas—organize them under these headings rather than replacing them unless the product has changed.
- If there’s a known caveat (pricing, performance), surface it early in a `<Warning>` so readers don’t get surprised later.
- Optional but encouraged: add a Mermaid diagram right after the intro to show how components connect; delete it if the story is obvious without visuals.
- Add a `## Configure access` snippet (even if it’s “Confirm your Mem0 API key is already configured”) so contributors never forget to mention the baseline setup.

### 2. **Middle – How it works**
- Create three predictable sections:
  1. **Feature anatomy** – Diagram or bullet list of moving parts. Use a table if you need to compare modes (platform vs OSS).
  2. **Configure it** – Step-by-step enabling instructions with `<CodeGroup>` or JSON/YAML snippets. Follow each code block with a short explanation of why it matters.
  3. **See it in action** – End-to-end example (often reusing operation snippets). Pair code with `<Info icon="check">` for expected results and `<Tip>` for optimization hints.
- Insert `<Note>` blocks for cross-links (e.g., “Also available via REST endpoint `/v1/...`”).
- Keep the tone instructive but light—no long manifestos.

### 3. **End – Evaluate and go deeper**
- Add an `## Verify the feature is working` section with bullets (metrics, logs, dashboards).
- Follow with `## Best practices` or `## Tuning tips` (3–4 bullets max).
- Close with the standard two-card CTA pair: left card = related concept or architecture page, right card = cookbook/application. Keep the comment reminder to double-check links.
- If providers differ meaningfully, summarize them in a final accordion (`<AccordionGroup>` with one `<Accordion>` per provider) so readers can expand what they need without scrolling walls of configuration.

# Advanced Retrieval

Mem0’s advanced retrieval elevates search accuracy when basic keyword matches aren’t enough. Turn it on when you need precise context for high-stakes conversations.

<Info>
  **You’ll use this when…**
  - You need semantic ranking across long-running agents
  - Compliance requires tight control over returned memories
  - Personalization hinges on precise filters
</Info>

<Warning>
  Advanced retrieval currently applies to managed Platform projects only. Self-hosted users should rely on the OSS reranker configuration.
</Warning>

{/* Optional: remove if no diagram is needed */}
```mermaid
%% Diagram the moving parts (delete when you fill this out)
graph TD
  A[Input] */} B[Feature]
  B */} C[Output]
```

## Feature anatomy

- Outline the moving parts (retriever, reranker, filters).
- Add a table comparing default vs advanced behavior.

## Configure it

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client = Client(...)
client.memories.search(criteria={...})
```

```ts TypeScript
const memories = await mem0.memories.search({ criteria: { ... } });
```
</CodeGroup>

Explain which knobs matter (e.g., `rerank_top_k`, `criteria`, `filters`).

<Tip>
  OSS users can mirror this by enabling the reranker in `config.yaml`. Link to the integration guide if relevant.
</Tip>

## See it in action

Walk through a real request/response. Include sample payloads and highlight notable fields.

<Info icon="check">
  Expect the top memory to match the user persona you set earlier. If not, revisit your filters.
</Info>

## Provider setup {/* Delete if not applicable */}

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="[Provider name]">
  Outline configuration or link to provider docs here.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verify the feature is working

- Watch the dashboard analytics for retrieval latency changes.
- Check logs for `reranker_applied: true`.

## Best practices

- Keep criteria minimal—overfiltering hurts recall.
- Pair with Memory Filters for hybrid scoring.

Stick to this outline. Keep the “why” up front, the “how” in the middle, and the “where to go next” crystal clear at the end.
