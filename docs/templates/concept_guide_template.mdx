# Concept Guide Template

Concept guides establish a shared mental model before feature or API docs. Define the idea, show how it behaves over time, and point to practical follow-ups.

---

## ❌ DO NOT COPY — Guidance & Constraints
- Frontmatter must include `title`, `description`, `icon`. Lead with a definition + analogy in two sentences max.
- Add an `<Info>` block (“Why it matters”) with 2–3 bullets summarizing user impact. Use `<Warning>` near limitations or beta callouts.
- Introduce vocabulary via `## Key terms` (table or bullets) before diving deeper.
- When migrating legacy pages, preserve canonical distinctions (e.g., short-term vs long-term) and fold them into the template rather than replacing them with new frameworks.
- Organize the body with question-style headings (`How does it work?`, `When should you use it?`, `How it compares`). Optional diagrams should be left-to-right (`graph LR`).
- Include at least one light code/JSON snippet or data table so the concept ties back to implementation.
- Close with a “Put it into practice” checklist, “See it live” links, and the standard two-card CTA (left = feature/reference, right = applied cookbook).

## ✅ Publish Checklist
- [ ] Definition + analogy stay within two sentences.
- [ ] “Why it matters” bullets focus on user impact, not implementation detail.
- [ ] Key terms, lifecycle explanation, and comparison table are present (or intentionally removed when irrelevant).
- [ ] At least one code/JSON/table example grounds the concept.
- [ ] CTA pair links to a feature/reference (left) and applied tutorial (right).
