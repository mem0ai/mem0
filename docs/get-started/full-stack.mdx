title: '💻 Full stack'
---

Embedchain provides a clean and simple cli utility that lets you create full-stack RAG applications locally with a single command. 

## Prerequisite

Make sure that you have installed the following:
- Embedchain python package (`pip install embedchain`)
- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Get started

For the purpose of the demo, you have to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to start with but you can choose any llm by changing the configuration easily.

Now run the following commands:

```bash
ec create-app my-app
cd my-app
ec start
```

Once you run this command, Embedchain does the following:

1. Fetch full stack template that uses FastAPI for backend, and Next.JS template for frontend
2. Install necessary requirements
3. Launch the frontend and backend server for you to interact with

Once you are done, visit `http://localhost:3000` and you will see a chat UI as shown below.

You can navigate to [Embedchain admin panel] where  you can see the chunks created for your documents that you ingested for your RAG application. Below is a screenshot for the same:
