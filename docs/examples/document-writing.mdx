This guide demonstrates how to leverage **Mem0** to edit documents efficiently, ensuring they align with your unique writing style and preferences.

## **Why Use Mem0?**

By integrating Mem0 into your workflow, you can streamline your document editing process with:

1. **Persistent Writing Preferences**: Mem0 stores and recalls your style preferences, ensuring consistency across all documents.
2. **Automated Enhancements**: Your stored preferences guide document refinements, making edits seamless and efficient.
3. **Scalability & Reusability**: Your writing style can be applied to multiple documents, saving time and effort.

## **Setup**

```python
import os
from mem0 import MemoryClient

# Set up Mem0 client
os.environ["MEM0_API_KEY"] = "your-mem0-api-key"
client = MemoryClient()

# Define constants
USER_ID = "content_writer"
RUN_ID = "smart_editing_session"
```

---
## **Storing Your Writing Preferences in Mem0**

```python
def store_writing_preferences():
    """Store your writing preferences in Mem0."""
    
    # Define writing preferences
    preferences = """My writing preferences:
1. Use headings and sub-headings for structure.
2. Keep paragraphs concise (8-10 sentences max).
3. Incorporate specific numbers and statistics.
4. Provide concrete examples.
5. Use bullet points for clarity.
6. Avoid jargon and buzzwords."""

    # Store preferences in Mem0
    preference_message = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Here are my writing style preferences"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": preferences}
    ]
    
    response = client.add(preference_message, user_id=USER_ID, run_id=RUN_ID, metadata={"type": "preferences", "category": "writing_style"})
    
    print("Writing preferences stored successfully.")
    return response
```
