title: '💼 Slack Bot'
---

### 🖼️ Setup

1. Create a workspace on Slack if you don't have one already by clicking [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/).
2. Create a new App on your Slack account by going [here](https://api.slack.com/apps).
3. Select `From Scratch`, then enter the Bot Name and select your workspace.
4. On the left Sidebar, go to `OAuth and Permissions` and add the following scopes under `Bot Token Scopes`:
```text
app_mentions:read
channels:history
channels:read
chat:write
```
5. Now select the option `Install to Workspace` and after it's done, copy the `Bot User OAuth Token` and set it in your secrets as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
6. Run your bot now with `python3 -m embedchain.bots.slack`
7. Expose your bot to the internet. Default port is `5000`, which can be changed by adding `port --8080` to the startup command. You can use your machine's public IP or DNS. Otherwise, employ a proxy server like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local bot accessible.
8. On the Slack API website go to `Event Subscriptions` on the left Sidebar and turn on `Enable Events`.
9. In `Request URL`, enter your server or ngrok address.
10. After it gets verified, click on `Subscribe to bot events`, add `message.channels` Bot User Event and click on `Save Changes`.
11. Now go to your workspace, right click on the bot name in the sidebar, click `view app details`, then `add this app to a channel`.

### 🚀 Usage Instructions

- Go to the channel where you have added your bot.
- To add data sources to the bot, use the command:
