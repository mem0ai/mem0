## Setting Up OpenMemory

Getting started with OpenMemory is straight forward and takes just a few minutes to set up on your local machine. Follow these steps:

### Getting started
First clone the repository and then follow the instructions:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0.git
cd mem0/openmemory

# Create the backend .env file with your OpenAI key
make env

# Build the Docker images
make build

# Start all services (API server, vector database, and MCP server components)
make up
```

You can configure the MCP client using the following command (replace username with your username):

```bash
npx install-mcp i "http://localhost:8765/mcp/cursor/sse/username" --client cursor
```

The OpenMemory dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000. From here, you can view and manage your memories, as well as check connection status with your MCP clients.

Once set up, OpenMemory runs locally on your machine, ensuring all your AI memories remain private and secure while being accessible across any compatible MCP client.
