## Try OpenMemory

You can try OpenMemory by running the following commands:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mem0ai/mem0/user/dyadav/openmemory/openmemory/run.sh | bash
```

You may find the following environment variables useful:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
```

You can configure the MCP client using the following command:

```bash
npx install-mcp i "http://localhost:8765/mcp/cursor/sse/{$whoami}" --client cursor
```

## Setting Up OpenMemory

Getting started with OpenMemory is straight forward and takes just a few minutes to set up on your local machine. Follow these steps:

### Getting started
First clone the repository and then follow the instructions:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0.git
cd mem0/openmemory

# Create the backend .env file with your OpenAI key
cd api
touch .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Return to project root and build the Docker images
cd ..
make build

# Start all services (API server, vector database, and MCP server components)
make up 

# Start the frontend
cp ui/.env.example ui/.env
make ui
```

### Configure Your MCP Client
To connect Cursor, Claude Desktop, or other MCP clients, you'll need your user ID. You can find it by running:
```bash
whoami
```

Then add the following configuration to your MCP client (replace your-username with your username):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem0-mcp-server": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8765/mcp/sse/your-username",
      "clientName": "mem0-mcp-client"
    }
  }
}
```

The OpenMemory dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000. From here, you can view and manage your memories, as well as check connection status with your MCP clients.

Once set up, OpenMemory runs locally on your machine, ensuring all your AI memories remain private and secure while being accessible across any compatible MCP client.
