Integrate Claude Code with Mem0’s OpenMemory MCP for persistent memory using native SSE.

## Overview

Claude Code acts as an agent that communicates with Mem0’s MCP server. This enables real-time memory using Claude as a developer agent/assistant.

## Setup Instructions
The simple one liner to add Mem0’s MCP server with native SSE support (not translated into stdio) is:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user -t sse OpenMemory http://localhost:8765/mcp/openmemory/sse/$(whoami)
```
