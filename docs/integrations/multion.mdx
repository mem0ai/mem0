title: MultiOn
---

Build a personal browser agent that remembers user preferences and automates web tasks. It integrates Mem0 for memory management with MultiOn for executing browser actions, enabling personalized and efficient web interactions.

## Overview

In this guide, we'll explore two examples of creating Browser-based AI Agents:
1. An agent that searches [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) for research papers relevant to user's research interests.
2. A travel agent that provides personalized travel information based on user preferences. Refer to the [notebook](https://github.com/MULTI-ON/cookbook/blob/main/personalized-travel-agent/mem0_travel_agent.ipynb) for detailed code.

## Setup and Configuration

Install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install mem0ai multion openai
```

First, we'll import the necessary libraries and set up our configurations.

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory, MemoryClient
from multion.client import MultiOn
from openai import OpenAI

# Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-xxx'  # Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
MULTION_API_KEY = 'your-multion-key'  # Replace with your actual MultiOn API key
MEM0_API_KEY = 'your-mem0-key'  # Replace with your actual Mem0 API key
USER_ID = "your-user-id"

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = OPENAI_API_KEY
os.environ['MEM0_API_KEY'] = MEM0_API_KEY

# Initialize Mem0 and MultiOn
memory = Memory()  # For local usage
memory_client = MemoryClient()  # For API usage
multion = MultiOn(api_key=MULTION_API_KEY)
```

## Example 1: Research Paper Search Agent

### Add memories to Mem0

Define user data and add it to Mem0.

```python
USER_DATA = """
About me
- I'm Deshraj Yadav, Co-founder and CTO at Mem0, interested in AI and ML Infrastructure.
- Previously, I was a Senior Autopilot Engineer at Tesla, leading the AI Platform for Autopilot.
- I built EvalAI at Georgia Tech, an open-source platform for evaluating ML algorithms.
- Outside of work, I enjoy playing cricket in two leagues in the San Francisco.
"""

memory.add(USER_DATA, user_id=USER_ID)
print("User data added to memory.")
```

### Retrieving Relevant Memories

Define search command and retrieve relevant memories from Mem0.

```python
command = "Find papers on arxiv that I should read based on my interests."

relevant_memories = memory.search(command, user_id=USER_ID, limit=3)
relevant_memories_text = '\n'.join(mem['text'] for mem in relevant_memories)
print(f"Relevant memories:")
print(relevant_memories_text)
```

### Browsing arXiv

Use MultiOn to browse arXiv based on the command and relevant memories.

```python
prompt = f"{command}\n My past memories: {relevant_memories_text}"
browse_result = multion.browse(cmd=prompt, url="https://arxiv.org/")
print(browse_result)
```

## Example 2: Travel Agent

### Get Travel Information

Add conversation to Mem0 and create a function to get travel information based on user's question and optionally their preferences from memory.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
def get_travel_info(question, use_memory=True):
    if use_memory:
        previous_memories = memory_client.search(question, user_id=USER_ID)
        relevant_memories_text = ""
        if previous_memories:
            print("Using previous memories to enhance the search...")
            relevant_memories_text = '\n'.join(mem["memory"] for mem in previous_memories)
        
        command = "Find travel information based on my interests:"
        prompt = f"{command}\n Question: {question} \n My preferences: {relevant_memories_text}"
    else:
        command = "Find travel information based on my interests:"
        prompt = f"{command}\n Question: {question}"
    
    print("Searching for travel information...")    
    browse_result = multion.browse(cmd=prompt)
    return browse_result.message

# Example usage
question = "Show me flight details for it."
answer_without_memory = get_travel_info(question, use_memory=False)
answer_with_memory = get_travel_info(question, use_memory=True)

print("Answer without memory:", answer_without_memory)
print("Answer with memory:", answer_with_memory)

# Another example
question = "What is the best place to eat there?"
answer_without_memory = get_travel_info(question, use_memory=False)
answer_with_memory = get_travel_info(question, use_memory=True)

print("Answer without memory:", answer_without_memory)
print("Answer with memory:", answer_with_memory)
```

```json Conversation

        "role": "user",

## Conclusion

By integrating Mem0 with MultiOn, you've created personalized browser agents that remember user preferences and automate web tasks. The first example demonstrates a research-focused agent, while the second example shows a travel agent capable of providing personalized recommendations.

These examples illustrate how combining memory management with web browsing capabilities can create powerful, context-aware AI agents for various applications.
