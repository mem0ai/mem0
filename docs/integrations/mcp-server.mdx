## Integrating mem0 as an MCP Server in Cursor
[mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0-mcp) is a powerful tool designed to enhance AI-driven workflows, particularly in code generation and contextual memory. In this guide, we'll walk through integrating mem0 as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** within [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), an AI-powered coding editor.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
- Cursor IDE
- Python (>=3.8)
- Git
- [mem0-mcp](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0-mcp) (Clone the repository and set up as per the instructions in the README)


## Configuring Cursor to use mem0 as an MCP Server

1. **Open Cursor.**
2. **Navigate to `Settings` > `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `MCP Servers`.**
3. **Add a new provider using the MCP server:**
   - Click on **`Add new MCP server`**
   - Provide a name for the server, e.g. `mem0` and select type as `sse`
   - Enter the **SSE Endpoint**: `http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse`
4. **Save and Restart Cursor** to apply changes.

## Using mem0 in Cursor
Once integrated, mem0 can assist with contextual memory and AI-driven coding enhancements. Some key functionalities include:

### 1. Storing Coding Preferences
Mem0 can store and manage coding preferences, including:
- Complete code snippets with dependencies
- Language/framework versions
- Documentation and comments
- Best practices and example usage

### 2. Retrieving Stored Preferences
Access all stored coding references to:
- Review implementations
- Maintain consistency in coding practices

### 3. Semantic Search for Preferences
Use natural language queries to find:
- Code snippets
- Technical documentation
- Best practices
- Setup guides

## Benefits of Using mem0 in Cursor
- **Persistent Context Storage**: Retain and reuse coding insights across sessions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within Cursor as an MCP server.
- **Efficient Search**: Retrieve relevant coding insights using semantic search.

## Conclusion
By integrating mem0 as an MCP server within Cursor, you enhance your development workflow with AI-powered memory and context-aware assistance. Follow the steps above to set up and start leveraging mem0 in your coding environment.
