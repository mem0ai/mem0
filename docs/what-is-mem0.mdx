## What is Mem0?

Mem0 is a memory layer built for AI agents and language model applications. It gives your systems a persistent memory—so they no longer start each interaction with a blank slate. This means agents can recall useful context, learn from past conversations, and adapt over time.

Unlike one-off prompt engineering or relying solely on an LLM’s context window, Mem0 lets your AI:

- Remember user preferences, past conversations, instructions, and facts
- Recall that information when it matters again
- Update memories over time—without repeating everything in each prompt


## Why Choose Mem0?

Chatbots and AI agents typically lose all context once a session ends. That leads to:

- Frustrating repetition for users
- Missed context and personalization opportunities
- Higher compute costs from re-sending redundant information

Mem0 addresses these by offering:

1. **Persistent memory** across sessions and users
2. **Structured updates**, including modifying or discarding memories
3. **Efficient retrieval** with vector search and metadata filtering
4. **Easy integration**—install, import, and you’re ready in under five minutes


## How It Works

At the core, Mem0 combines:

1. **LLMs** to extract key information from conversations
2. **Embedding models** to translate information into searchable vectors
3. **Vector databases** (like Qdrant, Weaviate, Redis, Elastic) for fast retrieval
4. **APIs and SDKs** for sequencing memory add, search, and update operations

You plug Mem0 into your agent framework—it doesn’t replace your LLM or workflows. Instead, it adds a smart memory layer on top.


## What You Can Build

Here’s what becomes possible when your AI can remember:

- A tutor that recalls learning progress over multiple sessions
- A voice assistant that recognizes returning users and conversations
- A support bot that picks up on previous tickets without asking again
- A companion app that builds a personality based on past interaction


## Core Capabilities

- **Reduced token usage and faster responses**: sub-50 ms lookups
- **Semantic memory**: procedural, episodic, and factual support
- **Multimodal support**: handle both text and images
- **Graph memory**: connect insights and entities across sessions
- **Host your way**: either a managed service or a self-hosted version
