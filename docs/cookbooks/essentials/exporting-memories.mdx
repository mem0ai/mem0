title: Export Stored Memories
description: "Retrieve, review, and migrate user memories with structured exports."
---


Mem0 is a dynamic memory store that gives you full control over your data. Along with storing memories, it gives you the ability to retrieve, export, and migrate your data whenever you need.

This cookbook shows you how to retrieve and export your data for inspection, migration, or compliance.

---

## Setup

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

```

Let's add some sample memories to work with:

```python
# Dev's work history
client.add(
    "Dev works at TechCorp as a senior engineer",
    user_id="dev",
    metadata={"type": "professional"}
)

# Arjun's preferences
client.add(
    "Arjun prefers morning meetings and async communication",
    user_id="arjun",
    metadata={"type": "preference"}
)

# Carl's project notes
client.add(
    "Carl is leading the API redesign project, targeting Q2 launch",
    user_id="carl",
    metadata={"type": "project"}
)

```

---

## Getting All Memories

Use `get_all()` with filters to retrieve everything for a specific user:

```python
dev_memories = client.get_all(
    filters={"user_id": "dev"},
    page_size=50
)

print(f"Total memories: {dev_memories['count']}")
print(f"First memory: {dev_memories['results'][0]['memory']}")

```

**Output:**

```
Total memories: 1
First memory: Dev works at TechCorp as a senior engineer

```

You can filter by metadata to get specific types:

```python
carl_projects = client.get_all(
    filters={
        "AND": [
            {"user_id": "carl"},
            {"metadata": {"type": "project"}}
        ]
    }
)

for memory in carl_projects['results']:
    print(memory['memory'])

```

**Output:**

```
Carl is leading the API redesign project, targeting Q2 launch

```

---

## Searching Memories

When you need semantic search instead of retrieving everything, use `search()`:

```python
results = client.search(
    query="What does Dev do for work?",
    filters={"user_id": "dev"},
    top_k=5
)

for result in results['results']:
    print(f"{result['memory']} (score: {result['score']:.2f})")

```

**Output:**

```
Dev works at TechCorp as a senior engineer (score: 0.89)

```

Search works across all memory fields and ranks by relevance. Use it when you have a specific question, use `get_all()` when you need everything.

---

## Exporting to Structured Format

For migrations or compliance, you can export memories into a structured schema using Pydantic-style JSON schemas.

### Step 1: Define the schema

```python
professional_profile_schema = {
    "properties": {
        "full_name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The person's full name"
        },
        "current_role": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Current job title or role"
        },
        "company": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Current employer"
        }
    },
    "title": "ProfessionalProfile",
    "type": "object"
}

```

### Step 2: Create export job

```python
export_job = client.create_memory_export(
    schema=professional_profile_schema,
    filters={"user_id": "dev"}
)

print(f"Export ID: {export_job['id']}")
print(f"Status: {export_job['status']}")

```

**Output:**

```
Export ID: exp_abc123
Status: processing

```

### Step 3: Download the export

```python
# Get by ID
export_data = client.get_memory_export(
    memory_export_id=export_job['id']
)

print(export_data['data'])

```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "full_name": "Dev",
  "current_role": "senior engineer",
  "company": "TechCorp"
}

```

You can also retrieve exports by filters:

```python
# Get latest export matching filters
export_by_filters = client.get_memory_export(
    filters={"user_id": "dev"}
)

print(export_by_filters['data'])

```

## Adding Export Instructions

Guide how Mem0 resolves conflicts or formats the export:

```python
export_with_instructions = client.create_memory_export(
    schema=professional_profile_schema,
    filters={"user_id": "arjun"},
    export_instructions="""
1. Use the most recent information if there are conflicts
2. Only include confirmed facts, not speculation
3. Return null for missing fields rather than guessing
"""
)

```

---

## Platform Export

You can also export memories directly from the Mem0 platform UI:

1. Navigate to **Memory Exports** in your project dashboard
2. Click **Create Export**
3. Select your filters and schema
4. Download the completed export as JSON

This is useful for one-off exports or manual data reviews.

---

## Summary

You've learned how to retrieve and export memories from Mem0:

- **`get_all()`** - Fetch all memories matching filters
- **`search()`** - Semantic search for specific queries
- **`create_memory_export()`** - Generate structured exports with schemas
- **`get_memory_export()`** - Download completed exports

Use `get_all()` for bulk retrieval, `search()` for specific questions, and exports for migrations or compliance needs.

**Next steps:**

- Memory expiration (automatic cleanup of old data)
- Quality control (filtering what gets stored)
- Graph memory (relationship-based retrieval)
