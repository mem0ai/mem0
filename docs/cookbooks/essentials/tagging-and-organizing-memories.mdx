title: Tag and Organize Memories
description: "Let Mem0 auto-categorize support data so teams retrieve the right facts fast."
---


When you have large volumes of memory data, sorting it during post-processing becomes difficult. What if your memory store understood the importance of creating tags and buckets without a lot of effort?

Mem0 handles this for you by providing the flexibility to organize memories with custom categories. This cookbook shows you how to tag and organize memories for a customer support platform.

---

## Setup

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")
```

---

## The Problem

Without categories, all memories sit in one undifferentiated bucket. Support agents waste time searching through everything to find billing issues, account details, or past tickets.

Let's see what happens without organization:

```python
# Joseph (support agent) stores various customer interactions
client.add(
    "Maria called about her account password reset",
    user_id="maria",
)

client.add(
    "Maria was charged twice for last month's subscription",
    user_id="maria",
)

client.add(
    "Maria wants to upgrade to the premium plan",
    user_id="maria",
)

# Now try to find just billing issues
all_memories = client.get_all(filters={"user_id": "maria"})
print(f"Total memories: {len(all_memories['results'])}")

for memory in all_memories['results']:
    print(f"- {memory['memory']}")

```

**Output:**

```
Total memories: 3
- Maria called about her account password reset
- Maria was charged twice for last month's subscription
- Maria wants to upgrade to the premium plan

```

Everything is mixed together. Support agents have to read through all memories to find what they need.

---

## Custom Categories

Define categories that match how your support team thinks about customer issues:

```python
custom_categories = [
    {"support_tickets": "Customer issues and resolutions"},
    {"account_info": "Account details and preferences"},
    {"billing": "Payment history and billing questions"},
    {"product_feedback": "Feature requests and feedback"},
]

client.project.update(custom_categories=custom_categories)

```

These categories are now available project-wide. Every memory can be tagged with one or more categories.

---

## Tagging Memories

Once categories are defined at the project level, Mem0 automatically assigns them based on content:

```python
# Billing issue - automatically tagged as "billing"
client.add(
    "Maria was charged twice for last month's subscription",
    user_id="maria",
    metadata={"priority": "high", "source": "phone_call"}
)

# Account update - automatically tagged as "account_info"
client.add(
    "Maria changed her email to maria.new@example.com",
    user_id="maria",
    metadata={"source": "web_portal"}
)

# Product feedback - automatically tagged as "product_feedback"
client.add(
    "Maria requested a dark mode feature for the dashboard",
    user_id="maria",
    metadata={"source": "chat"}
)

```

Mem0 reads the content and intelligently assigns the appropriate categories. You don't manually tag - the platform does it for you based on the category definitions.

---

## Retrieving by Category

Filter memories by category to find exactly what you need:

```python
# Joseph needs to pull all billing issues for audit
billing_issues = client.get_all(
    filters={
        "AND": [
            {"user_id": "maria"},
            {"categories": {"in": ["billing"]}}
        ]
    }
)

print("Billing issues:")
for memory in billing_issues['results']:
    print(f"- {memory['memory']}")

```

**Output:**

```
Billing issues:
- Maria was charged twice for last month's subscription

```

Only billing-related memories are returned. No need to filter through account updates or feedback.

You can also retrieve multiple categories:

```python
# Get both account info and billing
account_and_billing = client.get_all(
    filters={
        "AND": [
            {"user_id": "maria"},
            {"categories": {"in": ["account_info", "billing"]}}
        ]
    }
)

for memory in account_and_billing['results']:
    print(f"[{memory['categories'][0]}] {memory['memory']}")

```

**Output:**

```
[account_info] Maria changed her email to maria.new@example.com
[billing] Maria was charged twice for last month's subscription

```

---

## Updating Categories

Categories are automatically assigned based on content. To trigger re-categorization, update the memory content:

```python
# Find memories that need re-categorization
needs_update = client.get_all(
    filters={
        "AND": [
            {"user_id": "maria"},
            {"categories": {"in": ["misc"]}}
        ]
    }
)

# Update memory content to trigger re-categorization
for memory in needs_update['results']:
    client.update(
        memory_id=memory['id'],
        data=memory['memory']  # Re-process with current category definitions
    )

```

When you update a memory, Mem0 re-analyzes it against your current category definitions. This is useful when you introduce new categories or refine category descriptions.

## Summary

You've learned how to organize memories with custom categories in Mem0:

- **Define categories** with `client.project.update(custom_categories=[...])`
- **Automatic tagging** - Mem0 intelligently assigns categories based on content
- **Retrieve by category** using filters with `categories: {in: [...]}`
- **Re-categorize memories** by updating content to trigger re-analysis
- **Multiple categories** - Mem0 can assign multiple categories when appropriate

Categories make retrieval faster, analytics clearer, and compliance easier. Instead of searching through everything, support agents can jump directly to the type of information they need.

**Next steps:**

- Memory expiration (automatically clean up old support tickets)
- Quality control (filter what gets stored)
- Exporting memories (bulk export by category)
