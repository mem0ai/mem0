title: Build a Companion with Mem0
description: "Spin up a fitness coach that remembers goals, adapts tone, and keeps sessions personal."
---


Essentially, creating a companion out of LLMs is as simple as a loop. But these loops work great for one type of character without personalization and fall short as soon as you restart the chat.

Problem: LLMs are stateless. GPT doesn't remember conversations. You could stuff everything inside the context window, but that becomes slow, expensive, and breaks at scale.

The solution: Mem0. It extracts and stores what matters from conversations, then retrieves it when needed. Your companion remembers user preferences, past events, and history.

In this cookbook we'll build a **fitness companion** that:

- Remembers user goals across sessions
- Recalls past workouts and progress
- Adapts its personality based on user preferences
- Handles both short-term context (today's chat) and long-term memory (months of history)

By the end, you'll have a working fitness companion and know how to handle common production challenges.

## The Basic Loop with Memory

Max wants to train for a marathon. He starts chatting with Ray, an AI running coach.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from mem0 import MemoryClient

openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-key")
mem0_client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-mem0-key")

def chat(user_input, user_id):
    # Retrieve relevant memories
    memories = mem0_client.search(user_input, user_id=user_id, limit=5)
    context = "\\n".join(m["memory"] for m in memories["results"])

    # Call LLM with memory context
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": f"You're Ray, a running coach. Memories:\\n{context}"},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ]
    ).choices[0].message.content

    # Store the exchange
    mem0_client.add([
        {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response}
    ], user_id=user_id)

    return response

```

**Session 1:**

```python
chat("I want to run a marathon in under 4 hours", user_id="max")
# Output: "That's a solid goal. What's your current weekly mileage?"
# Stored in Mem0: "Max wants to run sub-4 marathon"

```

**Session 2 (next day, app restarted):**

```python
chat("What should I focus on today?", user_id="max")
# Output: "Based on your sub-4 marathon goal, let's work on building your aerobic base..."

```

<Info>
Ray remembers Max's goal across sessions. The app restarted, but the memory persisted. This is the core pattern: retrieve memories, pass them as context, store new exchanges.
</Info>

Ray remembers. Restart the app, and the goal persists. From here on, we'll focus on just the Mem0 API calls.

---

## Organizing Memory by Type

### Separating Temporary from Permanent

Max mentions his knee hurts. That's different from his marathon goal - one is temporary, the other is long-term.

**Categories vs Metadata:**

- **Categories**: AI-assigned by Mem0 based on content (you can't force them)
- **Metadata**: Manually set by you for forced tagging

Define custom categories at the project level. Mem0 will automatically tag memories with relevant categories based on content:

```python
mem0_client.project.update(custom_categories=[
    {"goals": "Race targets and training objectives"},
    {"constraints": "Injuries, limitations, recovery needs"},
    {"preferences": "Training style, surfaces, schedules"}
])

```

<Note>
**Categories vs Metadata:** Categories are AI-assigned by Mem0 based on content semantics. You define the palette, Mem0 picks which ones apply. If you need guaranteed tagging, use `metadata` instead.
</Note>

Now when you add memories, Mem0 automatically assigns the appropriate categories:

```python
# Add goal - Mem0 automatically tags it as "goals"
mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Sub-4 marathon is my A-race"}],
    user_id="max"
)

# Add constraint - Mem0 automatically tags it as "constraints"
mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "My right knee flares up on downhills"}],
    user_id="max"
)

```

Mem0 reads the content and intelligently picks which categories apply. You define the palette, it handles the tagging.

**Important:** You cannot force specific categories. Mem0's platform decides which categories are relevant based on content. If you need to force-tag something, use `metadata` instead:

```python
# Force tag using metadata (not categories)
mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Some workout note"}],
    user_id="max",
    metadata={"workout_type": "speed", "forced_tag": "custom_label"}
)

```

### Filtering by Category

Retrieve just constraints for workout planning:

```python
constraints = mem0_client.search(
    query="injury concerns",
    filters={
        "AND": [
            {"user_id": "max"},
            {"categories": {"in": ["constraints"]}}
        ]
    },
    threshold=0.0  # optional: widen recall for short phrases
)
print([m["memory"] for m in constraints["results"]])
# Output: ["Max's right knee flares up on downhills"]

```

Ray can plan workouts that avoid aggravating Max's knee, without pulling in race goals or other unrelated memories.

---

## Filtering What Gets Stored

### The Problem

Run the basic loop for a week and check what's stored:

```python
memories = mem0_client.get_all(filters={"AND": [{"user_id": "max"}]})
print([m["memory"] for m in memories["results"]])
# Output: ["Max wants to run marathon under 4 hours", "hey", "lol ok", "cool thanks", "gtg bye"]

```

<Warning>
Without filters, Mem0 stores everything—greetings, filler, and casual chat. This pollutes retrieval: instead of pulling "marathon goal," you get "lol ok." Set custom instructions to keep memory clean.
</Warning>

Noise. Greetings and filler clutter the memory.

### Custom Instructions

Tell Mem0 what matters:

```python
mem0_client.project.update(custom_instructions="""
Extract from running coach conversations:
- Training goals and race targets
- Physical constraints or injuries
- Training preferences (time of day, surfaces, weather)
- Progress milestones

Exclude:
- Greetings and filler
- Casual chatter
- Hypotheticals unless planning related
""")

```

Now chat again:

```python
chat("hey how's it going", user_id="max")
chat("I prefer trail running over roads", user_id="max")

memories = mem0_client.get_all(filters={"AND": [{"user_id": "max"}]})
print([m["memory"] for m in memories["results"]])
# Output: ["Max wants to run marathon under 4 hours", "Max prefers trail running over roads"]

```

<Info>
**Expected output:** Only 2 memories stored—the marathon goal and trail preference. The greeting "hey how's it going" was filtered out automatically. Custom instructions are working.
</Info>

Only meaningful facts. Filler gets dropped automatically.

---

---

## Agent Memory for Personality

### Why Agents Need Memory Too

Max prefers direct feedback, not motivational fluff. Ray needs to remember how to communicate - that's agent memory, separate from user memory.

Store agent personality:

```python
mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "system", "content": "Max wants direct, data-driven feedback. Skip motivational language."}],
    agent_id="ray_coach"
)

```

Retrieve agent style alongside user memories:

```python
# Get coach personality
agent_memories = mem0_client.search("coaching style", agent_id="ray_coach")
# Output: ["Max wants direct, data-driven feedback. Skip motivational language."]

# Store conversations with agent_id
mem0_client.add([
    {"role": "user", "content": "How'd my run look today?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pace was 8:15/mile. Heart rate 152, zone 2."}
], user_id="max", agent_id="ray_coach")

```

<Info>
**Expected behavior:** Ray's responses are now data-driven and direct. The agent memory stored the coaching style preference, so future responses adapt automatically without Max having to repeat his preference.
</Info>

No "Great job!" or "Keep it up!" - just data. Ray adapts to Max's preference.

## Managing Short-Term Context

### When to Store in Mem0

Don't send every single message to Mem0. Keep recent context in memory, let Mem0 handle the important long-term facts.

```python
# Store only meaningful exchanges in Mem0
mem0_client.add([
    {"role": "user", "content": "I want to run a marathon"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's build a training plan"}
], user_id="max")

# Skip storing filler
# "hey" → don't store
# "cool thanks" → don't store

# Or rely on custom_instructions to filter automatically

```

Last 10 messages in your app's buffer. Important facts in Mem0. Faster, cheaper, still works.

---

## Time-Bound Memories

### Auto-Expiring Facts

Max tweaks his ankle. It'll heal in two weeks - the memory should expire too.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

expiration = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=14)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Rolled my left ankle, needs rest"}],
    user_id="max",
    expiration_date=expiration
)

```

In 14 days, this memory disappears automatically. Ray stops asking about the ankle.

---

## Putting It All Together

Here's the Mem0 setup combining everything:

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

mem0_client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-mem0-key")

# Configure memory filtering and categories
mem0_client.project.update(
    custom_instructions="""
    Extract: goals, constraints, preferences, progress
    Exclude: greetings, filler, casual chat
    """,
    custom_categories=[
        {"name": "goals", "description": "Training targets"},
        {"name": "constraints", "description": "Injuries and limitations"},
        {"name": "preferences", "description": "Training style"}
    ]
)

```

**Week 1 - Store goals and preferences:**

```python
mem0_client.add([
    {"role": "user", "content": "I want to run a sub-4 marathon"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it. Let's build a training plan."}
], user_id="max", agent_id="ray", categories=["goals"])

mem0_client.add([
    {"role": "user", "content": "I prefer trail running over roads"}
], user_id="max", categories=["preferences"])

```

**Week 3 - Temporary injury with expiration:**

```python
expiration = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=14)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Rolled ankle, need light workouts"}],
    user_id="max",
    categories=["constraints"],
    expiration_date=expiration
)

```

**Retrieve for context:**

```python
memories = mem0_client.search("training plan", user_id="max", limit=5)
# Gets: marathon goal, trail preference, ankle injury (if still valid)

```

Ray remembers goals, preferences, and personality. Handles temporary injuries. Works across sessions.

## Common Production Patterns

### Episodic Stories with run_id

Training for Boston is different from training for New York. Separate the memory threads:

```python
mem0_client.add(messages, user_id="max", run_id="boston-2025")
mem0_client.add(messages, user_id="max", run_id="nyc-2025")

# Retrieve only Boston memories
boston_memories = mem0_client.search(
    "training plan",
    user_id="max",
    run_id="boston-2025"
)

```

Each race gets its own episodic boundary. No cross-contamination.

### Importing Historical Data

Max has 6 months of training logs to backfill:

```python
old_logs = [
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Completed 20-mile long run"}],
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Hit 8:00 pace on tempo run"}],
]

for log in old_logs:
    mem0_client.add(log, user_id="max")

```

### Handling Contradictions

Max changes his goal from sub-4 to sub-3:45:

```python
# Find the old memory
memories = mem0_client.get_all(filters={"AND": [{"user_id": "max"}]})
goal_memory = [m for m in memories["results"] if "sub-4" in m["memory"]][0]

# Update it
mem0_client.update(goal_memory["id"], "Max wants to run sub-3:45 marathon")

```

Update instead of creating duplicates.

### Multiple Agents

Max works with Ray for running and Jordan for strength training:

```python
chat("easy run today", user_id="max", agent_id="ray")
chat("leg day workout", user_id="max", agent_id="jordan")

```

Each coach maintains separate personality memory while sharing user context.

### Filtering by Date

Prioritize recent training over old data:

```python
recent = mem0_client.search(
    "training progress",
    user_id="max",
    filters={"created_at": {"gte": "2025-10-01"}}
)

```

### Metadata Tagging

Tag workouts by type:

```python
mem0_client.add(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "10x400m intervals"}],
    user_id="max",
    metadata={"workout_type": "speed", "intensity": "high"}
)

# Later, find all speed workouts
speed_sessions = mem0_client.search(
    "speed work",
    user_id="max",
    filters={"metadata": {"workout_type": "speed"}}
)

```

### Pruning Old Memories

Delete irrelevant memories:

```python
mem0_client.delete(memory_id="mem_xyz")

# Or clear an entire run_id
mem0_client.delete_all(user_id="max", run_id="old-training-cycle")

```

## What You Built

A companion that:

- **Persists across sessions** - Mem0 storage
- **Filters noise** - custom instructions
- **Organizes by type** - categories
- **Adapts personality** - **`agent_id`**
- **Stays fast** - short-term buffer
- **Handles temporal facts** - expiration
- **Scales to production** - batching, metadata, pruning

This pattern works for any companion: fitness coaches, tutors, roleplay characters, therapy bots, creative writing partners.

---

<Tip>
Start with 2-3 categories max (e.g., goals, constraints, preferences). More categories dilute tagging accuracy. You can always add more later after seeing what Mem0 extracts.
</Tip>

---

## Production Checklist

Before launching:

- Set custom instructions for your domain
- Define 2-3 categories (goals, constraints, preferences)
- Add expiration strategy for time-bound facts
- Implement error handling for API calls
- Monitor memory quality in Mem0 dashboard
- Clear test data from production project
