# Introduction

[Mem0](https://mem0.dev/wd) (pronounced "mem-zero") enhances AI assistants by giving them persistent, contextual memory. AI systems using Mem0 actively learn from and adapt to user interactions over time.

Mem0's memory layer combines LLMs with vector based storage. LLMs extract and process key information from conversations, while the vector storage enables efficient semantic search and retrieval of memories. This architecture helps AI agents connect past interactions with current context for more relevant responses.

## Key Features

- **Memory Processing**: Uses LLMs to automatically extract and store important information from conversations while maintaining full context
- **Memory Management**: Continuously updates and resolves contradictions in stored information to maintain accuracy
- **Dual Storage Architecture**: Combines vector database for memory storage and graph database for relationship tracking
- **Smart Retrieval System**: Employs semantic search and graph queries to find relevant memories based on importance and recency
- **Simple API Integration**: Provides easy-to-use endpoints for adding (`add`) and retrieving (`search`) memories

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support Chatbots**: Create support agents that remember customer history, preferences, and past interactions to provide personalized assistance
- **Personal AI Tutors**: Build educational assistants that track student progress, adapt to learning patterns, and provide contextual help
- **Healthcare Applications**: Develop healthcare assistants that maintain patient history and provide personalized care recommendations
- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Power systems that learn from organizational interactions and maintain institutional knowledge
- **Personalized AI Assistants**: Create assistants that learn user preferences and adapt their responses over time

## Getting Started
