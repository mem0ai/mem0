# How Mem0 Searches Memory

Mem0’s search operation lets agents ask natural-language questions and get back the memories that matter most. It’s the bridge between everything you’ve stored and the next response your agent writes.

<Info>
  **Why it matters**
  - Retrieves the right facts without rebuilding prompts from scratch.
  - Supports both managed Platform and OSS so you can test locally and deploy at scale.
  - Keeps results relevant with filters, rerankers, and thresholds.
</Info>

## Key terms

- **Query** – Natural-language question or statement you pass to `search`.
- **Filters** – JSON logic (AND/OR, comparison operators) that narrows results by user, categories, dates, etc.
- **top_k / threshold** – Controls how many memories return and the minimum similarity score.
- **Rerank** – Optional second pass that boosts precision when a reranker is configured.

## Architecture

</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Query processing">
Mem0 cleans and enriches your natural-language query so the downstream embedding search is accurate.
</Step>
<Step title="Vector search">
Embeddings locate the closest memories using cosine similarity across your scoped dataset.
</Step>
<Step title="Filtering & reranking">
Logical filters narrow candidates; rerankers or thresholds fine-tune ordering.
</Step>
<Step title="Results delivery">
Formatted memories (with metadata and timestamps) return to your agent or calling service.
</Step>
</Steps>

This pipeline runs the same way for the hosted Platform API and the OSS SDK.

## Search with Mem0 Platform

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

query = "What do you know about me?"
filters = {
   "OR": [
      {"user_id": "alice"},
      {"agent_id": {"in": ["travel-assistant", "customer-support"]}}
   ]
}

results = client.search(query, filters=filters)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";

const client = new MemoryClient({apiKey: "your-api-key"});

const query = "I'm craving some pizza. Any recommendations?";
const filters = {
  AND: [
    { user_id: "alice" }
  ]
};

const results = await client.search(query, {
  filters
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Search with Mem0 Open Source

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import Memory

m = Memory()

# Simple search
related_memories = m.search("Should I drink coffee or tea?", user_id="alice")

# Search with filters
memories = m.search(
    "food preferences",
    user_id="alice",
    filters={"categories": {"contains": "diet"}}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { Memory } from 'mem0ai/oss';

const memory = new Memory();

// Simple search
const relatedMemories = memory.search("Should I drink coffee or tea?", { userId: "alice" });

// Search with filters (if supported)
const memories = memory.search("food preferences", {
    userId: "alice",
    filters: { categories: { contains: "diet" } }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info icon="check">
  Expect an array of memory documents. Platform responses include vectors, metadata, and timestamps; OSS returns your stored schema.

## Filter patterns

Filters help narrow down search results. Common use cases:

**Filter by Session Context:**
```python
# Get memories from a specific agent session
m.search("query", user_id="alice", agent_id="chatbot", run_id="session-123")
```

**Filter by Date Range:**
```python
# Platform only - date filtering
client.search("recent memories", filters={
    "AND": [
        {"user_id": "alice"},
        {"created_at": {"gte": "2024-07-01"}}
    ]
})
```

**Filter by Categories:**
```python
# Platform only - category filtering
client.search("preferences", filters={
    "AND": [
        {"user_id": "alice"},
        {"categories": {"contains": "food"}}
    ]
})
```

## Tips for better search

- **Use natural language**: Mem0 understands intent, so describe what you're looking for naturally
- **Scope with session IDs**: Always provide at least `user_id` to scope search to relevant memories
- **Combine filters**: Use AND/OR logic to create precise queries (Platform)
- **Consider wildcard filters**: Use wildcard filters (e.g., `run_id: "*"`) for broader matches
- **Tune parameters**: Adjust `top_k` for result count, `threshold` for relevance cutoff
- **Enable reranking**: Use `rerank=True` (default) when you have a reranker configured


### More Details

For the full list of filter logic, comparison operators, and optional search parameters, see the
[Search Memory API Reference](/api-reference/memory/search-memories).

## Managed vs OSS differences

| Capability | Mem0 Platform | Mem0 OSS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filters | Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, comparisons) with field-level access | Basic field filters, extend via Python hooks |
| Reranking | Toggle `rerank=True` with managed reranker catalog | Requires configuring local or third-party rerankers |
| Thresholds | Request-level configuration (`threshold`, `top_k`) | Controlled via SDK parameters |
| Response metadata | Includes confidence scores, timestamps, dashboard visibility | Determined by your storage backend |

## Put it into practice

- Revisit the <Link href="/core-concepts/memory-operations/add">Add Memory</Link> guide to ensure you capture the context you expect to retrieve.
- Configure rerankers and filters in <Link href="/platform/features/advanced-retrieval">Advanced Retrieval</Link> for higher precision.
