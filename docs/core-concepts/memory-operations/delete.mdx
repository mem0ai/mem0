# Remove Memories Safely

Deleting memories is how you honor compliance requests, undo bad data, or clean up expired sessions. Mem0 lets you delete a specific memory, a list of IDs, or everything that matches a filter.

<Info>
  **Why it matters**
  - Satisfies user erasure (GDPR/CCPA) without touching the rest of your data.
  - Keeps knowledge bases accurate by removing stale or incorrect facts.
  - Works for both the managed Platform API and the OSS SDK.
</Info>

## Key terms

- **memory_id** – Unique ID returned by `add`/`search` identifying the record to delete.
- **batch_delete** – API call that removes up to 1000 memories in one request.
- **delete_all** – Filter-based deletion by user, agent, run, or metadata.
- **immutable** – Flagged memories that cannot be updated; delete + re-add instead.

## How the delete flow works

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose the scope">
Decide whether you’re removing a single memory, a list, or everything that matches a filter.
</Step>
<Step title="Submit the delete call">
Call `delete`, `batch_delete`, or `delete_all` with the required IDs or filters.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify">
Confirm the response message, then re-run `search` or check the dashboard/logs to ensure the memory is gone.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Delete a single memory (Platform)

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

memory_id = "your_memory_id"
client.delete(memory_id=memory_id)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

client.delete("your_memory_id")
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info icon="check">
  You’ll receive a confirmation payload. The dashboard reflects the removal within seconds.
</Info>

## Batch delete multiple memories (Platform)

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

delete_memories = [
    {"memory_id": "id1"},
    {"memory_id": "id2"}
]

response = client.batch_delete(delete_memories)
print(response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

const deleteMemories = [
  { memory_id: "id1" },
  { memory_id: "id2" }
];

client.batchDelete(deleteMemories)
  .then(response => console.log('Batch delete response:', response))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>

## Delete memories by filter (Platform)

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Delete all memories for a specific user
client.delete_all(user_id="alice")
```

```javascript JavaScript
import MemoryClient from 'mem0ai';

const client = new MemoryClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

client.deleteAll({ user_id: "alice" })
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also filter by other parameters such as:

- `agent_id`
- `run_id`
- `metadata` (as JSON string)

<Warning>
  `delete_all` requires at least one filter (user, agent, run, or metadata). Calling it with no filters raises an error to prevent accidental data loss.
</Warning>

## Delete with Mem0 OSS

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mem0 import Memory

memory = Memory()

memory.delete(memory_id="mem_123")
memory.delete_all(user_id="alice")
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The OSS JavaScript SDK does not yet expose deletion helpers—use the REST API or Python SDK when self-hosting.
</Note>

## Use cases recap

- Forget a user’s preferences at their request.
- Remove outdated or incorrect facts before they spread.
- Clean up memories after session expiration or retention deadlines.
- Comply with privacy legislation (GDPR, CCPA) and internal policies.

## Method comparison

| Method | Use when | IDs required | Filters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `delete(memory_id)` | You know the exact record | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| `batch_delete([...])` | You have a list of IDs to purge | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| `delete_all(...)` | You need to forget a user/agent/run | ✖️ | ✔️ |
