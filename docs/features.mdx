## Core Memory Capabilities

All Mem0 implementations provide these fundamental memory management features:

### Memory Lifecycle
- **Add Memories**: Store new information with automatic deduplication and relevance filtering
- **Search & Retrieve**: Find relevant memories using semantic search and advanced filtering
- **Update Memories**: Modify existing memories while maintaining context and relationships
- **Delete Memories**: Remove outdated or irrelevant information with cascade options

### Intelligence Features
- **Adaptive Personalization**: Continuously learns and updates based on user interactions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation context across sessions and interactions
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses advanced NLP to extract and store meaningful information
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces token usage by storing only relevant context
