title: Azure OpenAI
---

To use Azure OpenAI embedding models, set the `EMBEDDING_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `EMBEDDING_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT`, `EMBEDDING_AZURE_ENDPOINT` and `EMBEDDING_AZURE_API_VERSION` environment variables. You can obtain the Azure OpenAI API key from the Azure.

### Usage

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["EMBEDDING_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
os.environ["EMBEDDING_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT"] = "your-deployment-name"
os.environ["EMBEDDING_AZURE_ENDPOINT"] = "your-api-base-url"
os.environ["EMBEDDING_AZURE_API_VERSION"] = "version-to-use"

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key" # For LLM


config = {
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "azure_openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "text-embedding-3-large"
            "azure_kwargs": {
                  "api_version": "",
                  "azure_deployment": "",
                  "azure_endpoint": "",
                  "api_key": "",
                  "default_headers": {
                    "CustomHeader": "your-custom-header",
                  }
              }
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movies? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I’m not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="john")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Memory } from 'mem0ai/oss';

const config = {
    embedder: {
        provider: "azure_openai",
        config: {
            model: "text-embedding-3-large",
            modelProperties: {
                endpoint: "your-api-base-url",
                deployment: "your-deployment-name",
                apiVersion: "version-to-use",
            }
        }
    }
}

const memory = new Memory(config);

const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movies? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I’m not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]

await memory.add(messages, { userId: "john" });
```

As an alternative to using an API key, the Azure Identity credential chain can be used to authenticate with Azure OpenAI. The list below shows the order of precedence for credential application:

1. **Environment Credential:**
Azure client ID, secret, tenant ID, or certificate in environment variables for service principal authentication.

2. **Workload Identity Credential:**
Utilizes Azure Workload Identity (relevant for Kubernetes and Azure workloads).

3. **Managed Identity Credential:**
Authenticates as a Managed Identity (for apps/services hosted in Azure with Managed Identity enabled), this is the most secure production credential.

4. **Shared Token Cache Credential / Visual Studio Credential (Windows only):**
Uses cached credentials from Visual Studio sign-ins (and sometimes VS Code if SSO is enabled).

5. **Azure CLI Credential:**
Uses the currently logged-in user from the Azure CLI (`az login`), this is the most common development credential.

6. **Azure PowerShell Credential:**
Uses the identity from Azure PowerShell (`Connect-AzAccount`).

7. **Azure Developer CLI Credential:**
Uses the session from Azure Developer CLI (`azd auth login`).

<Note> If an API is provided, it will be used for authentication over an Azure Identity </Note>

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Azure OpenAI on by default. To enable the needed role, follow these steps:
- In the Azure portal, go to the **Azure OpenAI** resource.
- Select **Access control (IAM)** in the left-hand menu. This is where you will manage role assignments for RBAC.
- Click **Add** > **Add role assignment**.
- Select the **Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor** role.
- On the **Members** tab, choose:
  - For production it is recommended to use a service principal or managed identity.
    - For a service principal: select **User, group, or service principal** and search for the service principal.
    - For a managed identity: select **Managed identity** and choose the managed identity.
  - For development, you can assign the role to a user account.
    - For development: select **User, group, or service principal** and pick a Azure Entra ID account (the same used with `az login`).
- Click **Review + assign**.

Below is a sample configuration for using Azure OpenAI with the Mem0 library:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory
# You can set the values directly in the config dictionary or use environment variables

os.environ["LLM_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT"] = "your-deployment-name"
os.environ["LLM_AZURE_ENDPOINT"] = "your-api-base-url"
os.environ["LLM_AZURE_API_VERSION"] = "version-to-use"

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "azure_openai_structured",
        "config": {
            "model": "your-deployment-name",
            "temperature": 0.1,
            "max_tokens": 2000,
            "azure_kwargs": {
                  "azure_deployment": "<your-deployment-name>",
                  "api_version": "<version-to-use>",
                  "azure_endpoint": "<your-api-base-url>",
                  "default_headers": {
                    "CustomHeader": "your-custom-header",
                  }
              }
        }
    }
}
```

**Environment Variables to set to use Azure Identity Credential:**
* For an Environment Credential, you will need to setup a Service Principal and set the following environment variables:
  - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Your Azure Active Directory tenant ID.
  - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of your service principal or managed identity.
  - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of your service principal.
* For a User-Assigned Managed Identity, you will need to set the following environment variable:
  - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of the user-assigned managed identity.
* For a System-Assigned Managed Identity, no additional environment variables are needed.

**Developer logins to use for a Azure Identity Credential:**
* For an Azure CLI Credential, you need to have the Azure CLI installed and logged in with `az login`.
* For an Azure PowerShell Credential, you need to have the Azure PowerShell module installed and logged in with `Connect-AzAccount`.
* For an Azure Developer CLI Credential, you need to have the Azure Developer CLI installed and logged in with `azd auth login`.
