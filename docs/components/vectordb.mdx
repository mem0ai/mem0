To use Qdrant you can do like this:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory


config = {
    "vectordb": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "test",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## Chroma

[Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) is an AI-native open-source vector database that simplifies building LLM apps by providing tools for storing, embedding, and searching embeddings with a focus on simplicity and speed.

To use ChromaDB you can do like this:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory


config = {
    "vectordb": {
        "provider": "chromadb",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "test",
            "path": "db",
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```
