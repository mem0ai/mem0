[Groq](https://groq.com/) is the creator of the world's first Language Processing Unit (LPU), providing exceptional speed performance for AI workloads running on their LPU Inference Engine.

In order to use LLMs from Groq, go to their [platform](https://console.groq.com/keys) and get the API key. Set the API key as `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable to use the model as given below in the example.

## Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key" # used for embedding model
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "groq",
        "config": {
            "model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768",
            "temperature": 0.1,
            "max_tokens": 1000,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## Config

All available parameters for the `groq` config are present in [Master List of All Params in Config](../config).
