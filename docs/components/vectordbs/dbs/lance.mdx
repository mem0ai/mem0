[LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) is a high-performance open-source vector database designed for fast, efficient similarity search and embedding storage. It is optimized for AI applications, offering a simple interface for managing and querying vector embeddings.

### Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xx"

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "lance",
        "config": {
            "table_name": "test",
            "uri": "db",
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movie? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Iâ€™m not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```

### Config
