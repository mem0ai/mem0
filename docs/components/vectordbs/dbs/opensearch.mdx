[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is an open-source, enterprise-grade search and observability suite that brings order to unstructured data at scale. OpenSearch supports k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) and allows you to store and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently.

### Installation

OpenSearch support requires additional dependencies. Install them with:

```bash
pip install opensearch>=2.8.0
```

### Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xx"

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "opensearch",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "mem0",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 9200,
            "embedding_model_dims": 1536
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movies? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Iâ€™m not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```

### Config

Let's see the available parameters for the `opensearch` config:
