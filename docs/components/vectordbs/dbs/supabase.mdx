[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension for vector similarity search. It offers a powerful and scalable solution for storing and querying vector embeddings.

Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) account and project, then get your connection string from Project Settings > Database. See the [docs](https://supabase.github.io/vecs/hosting/) for details.

### Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xx"

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "supabase",
        "config": {
            "connection_string": "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database",
            "collection_name": "memories",
            "index_method": "hnsw",  # Optional: defaults to "auto"
            "index_measure": "cosine_distance"  # Optional: defaults to "cosine_distance"
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movies? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```

### Config

Here are the parameters available for configuring Supabase:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connection_string` | PostgreSQL connection string (required) | None |
| `collection_name` | Name for the vector collection | `mem0` |
| `embedding_model_dims` | Dimensions of the embedding model | `1536` |
| `index_method` | Vector index method to use | `auto` |
| `index_measure` | Distance measure for similarity search | `cosine_distance` |

### Index Methods

The following index methods are supported:

- `auto`: Automatically selects the best available index method
- `hnsw`: Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph index (faster search, more memory usage)
- `ivfflat`: Inverted File Flat index (good balance of speed and memory)

### Distance Measures

Available distance measures for similarity search:

- `cosine_distance`: Cosine similarity (recommended for most embedding models)
- `l2_distance`: Euclidean distance
- `l1_distance`: Manhattan distance
- `max_inner_product`: Maximum inner product similarity

### Best Practices

1. **Index Method Selection**:
   - Use `hnsw` for fastest search performance when memory is not a constraint
   - Use `ivfflat` for a good balance of search speed and memory usage
   - Use `auto` if unsure, it will select the best method based on your data

2. **Distance Measure Selection**:
   - Use `cosine_distance` for most embedding models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
   - Use `max_inner_product` if your vectors are normalized
   - Use `l2_distance` or `l1_distance` if working with raw feature vectors

3. **Connection String**:
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive information in the connection string
   - Format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
