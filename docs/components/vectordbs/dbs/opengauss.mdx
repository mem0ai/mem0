[openGauss](https://gitee.com/opengaussorg) is an enterpris-grade open source relational database which support vector store with high-performance, high-performance, high-security, high-reliablity.

### Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xx"

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "opengauss",
        "config": {
            "user": "test",
            "password": "123",
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "5432",
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
