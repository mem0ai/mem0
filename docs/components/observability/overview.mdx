Tracing records the paths taken by requests as they propagate through various steps or components of an application. 

For instance, when a user interacts with a Mem0-powered application, tracing can capture the sequence of operations — such as retrieval, embedding generation, language model invocation, and response generation — providing a detailed timeline of the request's execution. This data can help you debug issues, analyze costs, measure latency, and optimize overall system performance.


## Usage

To enable observability through trace collection in Mem0, you need to instrument the application to capture traces. These traces will then be sent to a collector where they can be analyzed to gain insights into system performance, identify bottlenecks, and debug potential issues.
