## Overview

Organizations and projects provide multi-tenant support, access control, and team collaboration capabilities for Mem0 Platform. Use these APIs to build applications that support multiple teams, customers, or isolated environments.

<Info>
Organizations and projects are **optional** features. You can use Mem0 without them for single-user or simple multi-user applications.
</Info>

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-org/project Support**: Specify organization and project when initializing the Mem0 client to attribute API usage appropriately
- **Member Management**: Control access to data through organization and project membership
- **Access Control**: Only members can access memories and data within their organization/project scope
- **Team Isolation**: Maintain data separation between different teams and projects for secure collaboration

---

## Using Organizations & Projects

### Initialize with Org/Project Context

Example with the mem0 Python package:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient
client = MemoryClient(org_id='YOUR_ORG_ID', project_id='YOUR_PROJECT_ID')
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Node.js">

```javascript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";
const client = new MemoryClient({
  organizationId: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
});
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Project Management

The Mem0 client provides comprehensive project management through the `client.project` interface:

### Get Project Details

Retrieve information about the current project:

```python
# Get all project details
project_info = client.project.get()

# Get specific fields only
project_info = client.project.get(fields=["name", "description", "custom_categories"])
```

### Create a New Project

Create a new project within your organization:

```python
# Create a project with name and description
new_project = client.project.create(
    name="My New Project",
    description="A project for managing customer support memories"
)
```

### Update Project Settings

Modify project configuration including custom instructions, categories, and graph settings:

```python
# Update project with custom categories
client.project.update(
    custom_categories=[
        {"customer_preferences": "Customer likes, dislikes, and preferences"},
        {"support_history": "Previous support interactions and resolutions"}
    ]
)

# Update project with custom instructions
client.project.update(
    custom_instructions="..."
)

# Enable graph memory for the project
client.project.update(enable_graph=True)

# Update multiple settings at once
client.project.update(
    custom_instructions="...",
    custom_categories=[
        {"personal_info": "User personal information and preferences"},
        {"work_context": "Professional context and work-related information"}
    ],
    enable_graph=True
)
```

### Delete Project

<Warning>
This action will remove all memories, messages, and other related data in the project. **This operation is irreversible.**
</Warning>

Remove a project and all its associated data:

```python
# Delete the current project (irreversible)
result = client.project.delete()
```

---

## Member Management

Manage project members and their access levels:

```python
# Get all project members
members = client.project.get_members()

# Add a new member as a reader
client.project.add_member(
    email="colleague@company.com",
    role="READER"  # or "OWNER"
)

# Update a member's role
client.project.update_member(
    email="colleague@company.com",
    role="OWNER"
)

# Remove a member from the project
client.project.remove_member(email="colleague@company.com")
```

### Member Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **READER** | Can view and search memories, but cannot modify project settings or manage members |
| **OWNER** | Full access including project modification, member management, and all reader permissions |

---

## Async Support

All project methods are available in async mode:

```python
from mem0 import AsyncMemoryClient

async def manage_project():
    client = AsyncMemoryClient(org_id='YOUR_ORG_ID', project_id='YOUR_PROJECT_ID')

    # All methods support async/await
    project_info = await client.project.get()
    await client.project.update(enable_graph=True)
    members = await client.project.get_members()

# To call the async function properly
import asyncio
asyncio.run(manage_project())
```
