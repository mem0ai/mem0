title: 'Add Memories'
openapi: post /v1/memories/
---

Add new facts, messages, or metadata to a user’s memory store. The Add Memories endpoint accepts either raw text or conversational turns and commits them asynchronously so the memory is ready for later search, retrieval, and graph queries.

## Endpoint

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/v1/memories/`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

Memories are processed asynchronously by default. The response contains queued events you can track while the platform finalizes enrichment.

## Required headers

| Header | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization: Token <MEM0_API_KEY>` | Yes | API key scoped to your workspace. |
| `Accept: application/json` | Yes | Ensures a JSON response. |

## Request body

Provide at least one message or direct memory string. Most callers supply `messages` so Mem0 can infer structured memories as part of ingestion.

<CodeGroup>
```json Basic request
{
  "user_id": "alice",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "I moved to Austin last month." }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "source": "onboarding_form"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Common fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user_id` | string | No* | Associates the memory with a user. Provide when you want the memory scoped to a specific identity. |
| `messages` | array | No* | Conversation turns for Mem0 to infer memories from. Each object should include `role` and `content`. |
| `metadata` | object | Optional | Custom key/value metadata (e.g., `{"topic": "preferences"}`). |
| `infer` | boolean (default `true`) | Optional | Set to `false` to skip inference and store the provided text as-is. |
| `async_mode` | boolean (default `true`) | Optional | Controls asynchronous processing. Most clients leave this enabled. |
| `output_format` | string (default `v1.1`) | Optional | Response format. `v1.1` wraps results in a `results` array. |

> \* Provide at least one `messages` entry to describe what you are storing. For scoped memories, include `user_id`. You can also attach `agent_id`, `app_id`, `run_id`, `project_id`, or `org_id` to refine ownership.

## Response

Successful requests return an array of events queued for processing. Each event includes the generated memory text and an identifier you can persist for auditing.

<CodeGroup>
```json 200 response
[
  {
    "id": "mem_01JF8ZS4Y0R0SPM13R5R6H32CJ",
    "event": "ADD",
    "data": {
      "memory": "The user moved to Austin in 2025."
    }
  }
]
```

```json 400 response
{
  "error": "400 Bad Request",
  "details": {
    "message": "Invalid input data. Please refer to the memory creation documentation at https://docs.mem0.ai/platform/quickstart#4-1-create-memories for correct formatting and required fields."
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Graph relationships

Add Memories can enrich the knowledge graph on write. Set `enable_graph: true` to create entity nodes and relationships for the stored memory. Use this when you want downstream `get_all` or search calls to traverse connected entities.

<CodeGroup>
```json Graph-aware request
{
  "user_id": "alice",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "I met with Dr. Lee at General Hospital." }
  ],
  "enable_graph": true
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The response follows the same format, and related entities become available in [Graph Memory](/platform/features/graph-memory) queries.
