title: "Get Memories"
openapi: post /v2/memories/
---

The v2 get memories API is powerful and flexible, allowing for more precise memory listing without the need for a search query. It supports complex logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) and comparison operators for advanced filtering capabilities. The comparison operators include:

- `in`: Matches any of the values specified
- `gte`: Greater than or equal to
- `lte`: Less than or equal to
- `gt`: Greater than
- `lt`: Less than
- `ne`: Not equal to
- `icontains`: Case-insensitive containment check
- `*`: Wildcard character that matches everything

```python Code
memories = m.get_all(
    filters={
        "AND": [
            {
                "user_id": "alex"
            },
            {
                "created_at": {"gte": "2024-07-01", "lte": "2024-07-31"}
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

```python Output
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "f4cbdb08-7062-4f3e-8eb2-9f5c80dfe64c",
            "memory": "Alex is planning a trip to San Francisco from July 1st to July 10th",
            "created_at": "2024-07-01T12:00:00Z",
            "updated_at": "2024-07-01T12:00:00Z"

## Graph Memory

To retrieve graph memory relationships between entities, pass `output_format="v1.1"` in your request. This will return memories with entity and relationship information from the knowledge graph.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
memories = m.get_all(
    filters={
        "user_id": "alex"
    },
    output_format="v1.1"
)
```

```python Output
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "f4cbdb08-7062-4f3e-8eb2-9f5c80dfe64c",
            "memory": "Alex is planning a trip to San Francisco",
            "entities": [
                {
                    "id": "entity-1",
                    "name": "Alex",
                    "type": "person"
                },
                {
                    "id": "entity-2",
                    "name": "San Francisco",
                    "type": "location"
                }
            ],
            "relations": [
                {
                    "source": "entity-1",
                    "target": "entity-2",
                    "relationship": "traveling_to"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
