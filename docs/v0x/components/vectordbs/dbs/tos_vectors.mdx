[TOS Vectors](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6459/1166454) is a fully managed vector database service provided by Volcengine (ByteDance Cloud). It offers high-performance vector storage and similarity search capabilities, designed for AI applications such as recommendation systems, semantic search, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

### Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

# Set environment variables for TOS Vectors authentication
os.environ["TOS_ACCESS_KEY"] = "your-access-key"
os.environ["TOS_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret-key"
os.environ["TOS_ACCOUNT_ID"] = "your-account-id"

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "tos_vectors",
        "config": {
            "vector_bucket_name": "my-bucket",
            "collection_name": "my-collection",
            "embedding_model_dims": 1536,
            "endpoint": "https://tosvectors-cn-beijing.volces.com",
            "region": "cn-beijing",
            "distance_metric": "cosine"
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movie? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```

### Config

Here are the parameters available for configuring TOS Vectors:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vector_bucket_name` | Name of the TOS Vectors bucket | `mem0` |
| `collection_name` | Name of the collection/index | `mem0` |
| `embedding_model_dims` | Dimensions of the embedding model | `1536` |
| `endpoint` | Endpoint URL for TOS Vectors service | `https://tosvectors-cn-beijing.volces.com` |
| `region` | Region for TOS Vectors service | `cn-beijing` |
| `distance_metric` | Distance metric for similarity search | `cosine` |

### Environment Variables

TOS Vectors requires the following environment variables for authentication:

- `TOS_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Volcengine access key
- `TOS_SECRET_KEY`: Your Volcengine secret key
- `TOS_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Volcengine account ID

These credentials can be obtained from the [Volcengine Console](https://console.volcengine.com/).

### Distance Metrics

The following distance metrics are supported:

- `cosine`: Cosine similarity (default, recommended for most use cases)
- `euclidean`: Euclidean distance (L2 distance)

### Features

TOS Vectors provides the following key features:

- **High Performance**: Optimized for large-scale vector search with low latency
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle billions of vectors
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple collections and user isolation
- **Metadata Filtering**: Store and filter vectors by metadata
- **Real-time Updates**: Support for real-time vector insertion and updates

### Regions

TOS Vectors is available in the following regions:

- `cn-beijing`: China (Beijing)
- `cn-shanghai`: China (Shanghai)
- `cn-guangzhou`: China (Guangzhou)

Choose the region closest to your application for optimal performance.
