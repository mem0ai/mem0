## How to set custom categories?

Users can now create custom categories tailored to their specific needs, in addition to the default categories such as travel, sports, music, and more.
To setup the custom categories, user has to specify the category name and a description of what that category signifies.
Here’s how you can do it:

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

m = MemoryClient(api_key="xxx")

custom_categories = [
    {"cooking": "For users interested in cooking, including recipes, cooking tips, and culinary experiences."},
    {"fitness": "Includes content related to fitness, such as workouts, exercises, and fitness tips."}
]

messages = [
    {"role" : "user", "content" : "Hi, my name is Alice. I love to play badminton."},
    {"role" : "assistant", "content" : "Hello Alice! It's nice to meet you. Badminton is such an amazing sport. How can I assist you today?"},
    {"role" : "user", "content" : "I am a fitness freak, I go to gym daily."},
    {"role" : "assistant", "content" : "That's great! Regular exercise is very beneficial for health."},
    {"role" : "user", "content" : "Because of my gym plan, I mostly cook at home."},
    {"role" : "assistant", "content" : "Cooking at home is a good way to ensure you have a balanced diet."}
]
```

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
client.add(messages, user_id="alice", custom_categories=custom_categories)
```

```markdown Memories with categories
User's name is Alice (personal_details)
Loves playing badminton (sports)
User is a fitness freak. (fitness)
Likes to go to gym daily. (fitness)
Mostly cook at home because of gym plan. (fitness, cooking)
```
</CodeGroup>

> Note: The more detailed the description of categories is, the better output the user will receive.
