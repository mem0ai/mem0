Mem0 now supports an contextual add version (v2). To use it, set `version="v2"` during the add call. The default version is v1, which is deprecated now. We recommend migrating to `v2` for new applications.

## Key Differences Between v1 and v2

### Version 1 (Legacy)
In v1 (default), users needed to pass either the entire conversation history or past k messages with each new message to generate properly contextualized memories. This approach required:

- Manually tracking and sending previous messages using a sliding window approach
- Increased payload sizes as conversations grew longer, requiring careful window size management

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# First interaction
messages1 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex and I live in San Francisco."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you. San Francisco is a beautiful city."}
]
client.add(messages1, user_id="alex")

# Second interaction - must include previous messages for context
messages2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex and I live in San Francisco."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you. San Francisco is a beautiful city."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I like to eat sushi, and yesterday I went to Sunnyvale to eat sushi with my friends."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sushi is really a tasty choice. What did you do this weekend?"}
]
client.add(messages2, user_id="alex")
```

```javascript JavaScript
// First interaction
const messages1 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex and I live in San Francisco."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you. San Francisco is a beautiful city."}
];
client.add(messages1, { user_id: "alex" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Second interaction - must include previous messages for context
const messages2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex and I live in San Francisco."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you. San Francisco is a beautiful city."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I like to eat sushi, and yesterday I went to Sunnyvale to eat sushi with my friends."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sushi is really a tasty choice. What did you do this weekend?"}
];
client.add(messages2, { user_id: "alex" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Version 2 (Recommended)
In v2, Mem0 automatically manages conversation context. Users only need to send new messages, and the system will:

- Automatically retrieve relevant conversation history
- Generate properly contextualized memories
- Reduce payload sizes and simplify integration

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# First interaction
messages1 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex and I live in San Francisco."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you. San Francisco is a beautiful city."}
]
client.add(messages1, user_id="alex", version="v2")

# Second interaction - only need to send new messages
messages2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I like to eat sushi, and yesterday I went to Sunnyvale to eat sushi with my friends."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sushi is really a tasty choice. What did you do this weekend?"}
]
client.add(messages2, user_id="alex", version="v2")
```

```javascript JavaScript
// First interaction
const messages1 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex and I live in San Francisco."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you. San Francisco is a beautiful city."}
];
client.add(messages1, { user_id: "alex", version: "v2" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Second interaction - only need to send new messages
const messages2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I like to eat sushi, and yesterday I went to Sunnyvale to eat sushi with my friends."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sushi is really a tasty choice. What did you do this weekend?"}
];
client.add(messages2, { user_id: "alex", version: "v2" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

## Benefits of Using v2

1. **Simplified Integration**: No need to track and manage conversation history
2. **Reduced Payload Size**: Only send new messages, not the entire conversation
3. **Improved Memory Quality**: Automatic context retrieval ensures better memory generation

## Understanding ID Parameters in v2

When using contextual add v2, you have different options for how to organize and retrieve memories:

### Using Only `user_id`

When you provide only a `user_id`:

- Memories are associated with this user's long-term memory store
- The system will automatically retrieve relevant context from all of the user's previous conversations
- These memories persist indefinitely across all of the user's sessions
- Ideal for maintaining persistent user information (preferences, personal details, etc.)

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Adding to long-term user memory
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm allergic to peanuts and shellfish."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've noted your allergies to peanuts and shellfish."}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex", version="v2")
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Adding to long-term user memory
const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm allergic to peanuts and shellfish."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've noted your allergies to peanuts and shellfish."}
];
client.add(messages, { user_id: "alex", version: "v2" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

</CodeGroup>

### Using `user_id` with `run_id`

When you provide both `user_id` and `run_id`:

- Memories are associated with a specific conversation session or interaction
- The system will retrieve context primarily from this specific session
- These memories are still tied to the user but are organized by the specific session
- Ideal for maintaining context within a specific conversation flow or task
- Helps prevent context from different conversations from interfering with each other

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Adding to a specific conversation session
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "For this trip to Paris, I want to focus on art museums."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! I'll help you plan your Paris trip with a focus on art museums."}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex", run_id="paris-trip-2024", version="v2")

# Later in the same conversation session
messages2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'd like to visit the Louvre on Monday."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Louvre is a great choice for Monday. Would you like information about opening hours?"}
]
client.add(messages2, user_id="alex", run_id="paris-trip-2024", version="v2")
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Adding to a specific conversation session
const messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "For this trip to Paris, I want to focus on art museums."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! I'll help you plan your Paris trip with a focus on art museums."}
];
client.add(messages, { user_id: "alex", run_id: "paris-trip-2024", version: "v2" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Later in the same conversation session
const messages2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'd like to visit the Louvre on Monday."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Louvre is a great choice for Monday. Would you like information about opening hours?"}
];
client.add(messages2, { user_id: "alex", run_id: "paris-trip-2024", version: "v2" })
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

Using `run_id` helps you organize memories into logical sessions or tasks, making it easier to maintain context for specific interactions while still associating everything with the user's overall profile.
