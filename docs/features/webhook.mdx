## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when memory events occur in your Mem0 project. Webhooks are configured at the project level, meaning each webhook is associated with a specific project and will only receive events from that project. You can configure webhooks to send HTTP POST requests to your specified URLs whenever memories are created, updated, or deleted.

## Managing Webhooks

### Get Webhooks

Retrieve all webhooks configured for your project. By default, it uses the project_id from your client configuration, but you can optionally specify a different project:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Get webhooks for the default project
webhooks = client.get_webhooks()

# Or specify a different project
webhooks = client.get_webhooks(project_id="proj_123")
print(webhooks)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const { MemoryClient } = require('mem0ai');
const client = new MemoryClient('your-api-key');

// Get webhooks for the default project
const webhooks = await client.getWebhooks();

// Or specify a different project
const webhooks = await client.getWebhooks("proj_123");
console.log(webhooks);
```

```json Output
[
    {
        'webhook_id': "wh_123",
        'url': 'https://mem0.ai',
        'name': 'mem0',
        'owner': 'john',
        'project': 'default-project',
        'is_active': True,
        'created_at': '2025-02-18T22:59:56.804993-08:00',
        'updated_at': '2025-02-18T23:06:41.479361-08:00'
    }
]

```

</CodeGroup>

### Create Webhook

Create a new webhook for your project. The webhook will only receive events from the specified project:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Create a webhook in the default project
webhook = client.create_webhook(
    url="https://your-app.com/webhook",
    name="Memory Logger"
)

# Or create in a specific project
webhook = client.create_webhook(
    url="https://your-app.com/webhook",
    name="Memory Logger",
    project_id="proj_123"
)
print(webhook)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Create a webhook in the default project
const webhook = await client.createWebhook({
    url: "https://your-app.com/webhook",
    name: "Memory Logger"
});

// Or create in a specific project
const webhook = await client.createWebhook({
    url: "https://your-app.com/webhook",
    name: "Memory Logger",
    projectId: "proj_123"
});
console.log(webhook);
```

```json Output
{
  'webhook_id': "wh_123",
  'name': 'Memory Logger',
  'url': 'https://your-app.com/webhook',
  'project': 'default-project',
  'is_active': True,
  'created_at': '2025-02-18T22:59:56.804993-08:00',
  'updated_at': '2025-02-18T23:06:41.479361-08:00'
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Update Webhook

Modify an existing webhook's configuration. Remember that webhooks can only be updated within their associated project:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Update webhook in default project
updated_webhook = client.update_webhook(
    name="Updated Logger",
    url="https://your-app.com/new-webhook"
)

# Or update in a specific project
updated_webhook = client.update_webhook(
    name="Updated Logger",
    url="https://your-app.com/new-webhook"
)
print(updated_webhook)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Update webhook in default project
const updatedWebhook = await client.updateWebhook("wh_123", {
    name: "Updated Logger",
    url: "https://your-app.com/new-webhook"
});

// Or update in a specific project
const updatedWebhook = await client.updateWebhook("wh_123", {
    name: "Updated Logger",
    url: "https://your-app.com/new-webhook",
    projectId: "proj_123"
});
console.log(updatedWebhook);
```

```json Output
{
  "message": "Webhook updated successfully"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Delete Webhook

Remove a webhook configuration from a project:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Delete webhook from default project
response = client.delete_webhook(webhook_id="wh_123")

# Or delete from a specific project
response = client.delete_webhook(webhook_id="wh_123", project_id="proj_123")
print(response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Delete webhook from default project
const response = await client.deleteWebhook("wh_123");

// Or delete from a specific project
const response = await client.deleteWebhook("wh_123", "proj_123");
console.log(response);
```

```json Output
{
  "message": "Webhook deleted successfully"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Webhook Payload

When a memory event occurs in your project, Mem0 sends a POST request to your webhook URL with the following payload structure:

```json
{
    "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4g7h-8i9j-k0l1m2n3o4p5",
    "data": {
      "memory": "Name is Alex"
    },
    "event": "ADD"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Implement Retry Logic**: Your webhook endpoint should be able to handle temporary failures and implement appropriate retry mechanisms.

2. **Verify Webhook Source**: Implement security measures to verify that webhook requests are coming from Mem0.

3. **Process Events Asynchronously**: Handle webhook events asynchronously to prevent timeouts and ensure reliable processing.

4. **Monitor Webhook Health**: Regularly check your webhook logs to ensure proper functionality and handle any delivery failures.
