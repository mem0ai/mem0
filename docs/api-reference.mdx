Mem0 provides a powerful set of APIs that allow you to integrate advanced memory management capabilities into your applications. Our APIs are designed to be intuitive, efficient, and scalable, enabling you to create, retrieve, update, and delete memories across various entities such as users, agents, apps, and runs.

## Quick Start Guide

Get started with Mem0 API in three simple steps:

1. **[Add Memories](/api-reference/memory/add-memories)** - Store information and context from user conversations
2. **[Search Memories](/api-reference/memory/search-memories)** - Retrieve relevant memories based on queries
3. **[Get Memories](/api-reference/memory/get-memories)** - Fetch all memories for a specific entity

### Common Operations

  <Card title="Add Memories" icon="plus" href="/api-reference/memory/add-memories">
    Store new memories from conversations and interactions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Search Memories" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/api-reference/memory/v2-search-memories">
    Find relevant memories using semantic search
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update Memory" icon="pen" href="/api-reference/memory/update-memory">
    Modify existing memory content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete Memory" icon="trash" href="/api-reference/memory/delete-memory">
    Remove specific memories or batch delete
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Structure

Our API is organized into several main categories:

1. **[Memory APIs](#memory-apis)**: Core operations for managing individual memories and collections
2. **[Entities APIs](#entities-apis)**: Manage different entity types (users, agents, etc.) and their associated memories
3. **[Organizations APIs](#organizations-apis)**: Manage organizations and their members (optional)
4. **[Project APIs](#project-apis)**: Manage projects within organizations (optional)

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Token-based authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Token <your-api-key>
```

Get your API key from the [Mem0 Dashboard](https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys).

## Organizations and projects (optional)

Organizations and projects provide the following capabilities:

- **Multi-org/project Support**: Specify organization and project when initializing the Mem0 client to attribute API usage appropriately.
- **Member Management**: Control access to data through organization and project membership.
- **Access Control**: Only members can access memories and data within their organization/project scope.
- **Team Isolation**: Maintain data separation between different teams and projects for secure collaboration.

Example with the mem0 Python package:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient
client = MemoryClient(org_id='YOUR_ORG_ID', project_id='YOUR_PROJECT_ID')
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Node.js">

```javascript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";
const client = new MemoryClient({organizationId: "YOUR_ORG_ID", projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"});
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Project Management Methods

The Mem0 client provides comprehensive project management capabilities through the `client.project` interface:

#### Get Project Details

Retrieve information about the current project:

```python
# Get all project details
project_info = client.project.get()

# Get specific fields only
project_info = client.project.get(fields=["name", "description", "custom_categories"])
```

#### Create a New Project

Create a new project within your organization:

```python
# Create a project with name and description
new_project = client.project.create(
    name="My New Project",
    description="A project for managing customer support memories"
)
```

#### Update Project Settings

Modify project configuration including custom instructions, categories, and graph settings:

```python
# Update project with custom categories
client.project.update(
    custom_categories=[
        {"customer_preferences": "Customer likes, dislikes, and preferences"},
        {"support_history": "Previous support interactions and resolutions"}
    ]
)

# Update project with custom instructions
client.project.update(
    custom_instructions="..."
)

# Enable graph memory for the project
client.project.update(enable_graph=True)

# Update multiple settings at once
client.project.update(
    custom_instructions="...",
    custom_categories=[
        {"personal_info": "User personal information and preferences"},
        {"work_context": "Professional context and work-related information"}
    ],
    enable_graph=True
)
```

#### Delete Project

<Note>
This action will remove all memories, messages, and other related data in the project. This operation is irreversible.
</Note>

Remove a project and all its associated data:

```python
# Delete the current project (irreversible)
result = client.project.delete()
```

#### Member Management

Manage project members and their access levels:

```python
# Get all project members
members = client.project.get_members()

# Add a new member as a reader
client.project.add_member(
    email="colleague@company.com",
    role="READER"  # or "OWNER"
)

# Update a member's role
client.project.update_member(
    email="colleague@company.com",
    role="OWNER"
)

# Remove a member from the project
client.project.remove_member(email="colleague@company.com")
```

#### Member Roles

- **READER**: Can view and search memories, but cannot modify project settings or manage members.
- **OWNER**: Full access including project modification, member management, and all reader permissions.

#### Async Support

All project methods are also available in async mode:

```python
from mem0 import AsyncMemoryClient

async def manage_project():
    client = AsyncMemoryClient(org_id='YOUR_ORG_ID', project_id='YOUR_PROJECT_ID')

    # All methods support async/await
    project_info = await client.project.get()
    await client.project.update(enable_graph=True)
    members = await client.project.get_members()

# To call the async function properly
import asyncio
asyncio.run(manage_project())
```

## Getting Started

To begin using the Mem0 API, you'll need to:

1. Sign up for a [Mem0 account](https://app.mem0.ai) and obtain your API key.
2. Familiarize yourself with the API endpoints and their functionalities.
3. Make your first API call to add or retrieve a memory.

Explore the detailed documentation for each API endpoint to learn more about request/response formats, parameters, and example usage.
