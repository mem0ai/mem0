# Personal Memory Extraction

This guide explains how to extract, organize, and retrieve personal facts about users in mem0, making it ideal for building personalized AI assistants, tutors, or agents. While mem0 doesn't have specialized functionality specifically for personal facts, its general memory system can be configured for effective personal information management.

## Understanding Personal Memory Extraction

Mem0's general fact extraction system can be used to store and retrieve information about people, including their:

- Preferences and interests
- Demographic information
- Skills and background
- Relationships
- Goals and aspirations
- Past interactions and history

These personal facts provide essential context for AI systems to deliver personalized experiences. The default fact extraction prompt is already oriented toward personal information, as it mentions preferences, personal details, plans, health information, and professional information.

## Extracting Personal Facts

### Basic Fact Extraction

By default, mem0 uses its configured LLM to extract facts from conversations:

```python
from mem0 import Memory, MemoryConfig

memory = Memory()

# Add a conversation containing personal information
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, my name is Alexa. I'm 28 years old and I work as a data scientist in Chicago."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice to meet you, Alexa! I'd be happy to help with anything related to data science or Chicago living."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I love hiking on weekends and I'm allergic to shellfish."}
]

# Add to memory with user_id for future reference
memory.add(
    conversation,
    user_id="alexa-user-123"
)
```

The default fact extraction will identify and store key pieces of information like:
- Name: Alexa
- Age: 28
- Occupation: Data Scientist
- Location: Chicago
- Interest: Hiking
- Health: Shellfish allergy

### Custom Fact Extraction Prompt

For more focused personal fact extraction, you can customize the extraction prompt:

```python
# Create a memory instance with custom fact extraction prompt
personal_facts_config = MemoryConfig(
    custom_fact_extraction_prompt="""
    You are an expert at extracting personal facts about individuals.
    Your task is to identify and extract specific details about a person from the given text.
    Focus on extracting the following types of information:
    
    1. Personal identity (name, age, gender, location)
    2. Professional details (job, company, field, education)
    3. Preferences and interests (hobbies, likes/dislikes, favorites)
    4. Health information (allergies, dietary restrictions, medical conditions)
    5. Relationships (family, friends, significant others)
    6. Goals and aspirations
    7. Schedule and routines
    
    Extract each fact as a separate, concise statement in the format:
    "User [has/likes/wants/is] [fact]"
    
    Ensure each fact is specific, accurate, and clearly stated.
    """
)

personal_memory = Memory(personal_facts_config)

# Add personal information with custom extraction
personal_memory.add(
    "I'm Raj, a 32-year-old software engineer at Google. I have two kids (ages 4 and 6) and my wife is a doctor. I'm learning to play guitar and try to practice daily. I'm hoping to run a half-marathon next year.",
    user_id="raj-user-456"
)
```

## Organizing Personal Memories with Metadata

Metadata is crucial for organizing and retrieving personal information effectively.

### Categorizing Personal Facts

Add metadata categories to personal memories:

```python
# Define common categories for personal information
PERSONAL_CATEGORIES = {
    "identity": ["name", "age", "gender", "nationality", "location"],
    "professional": ["job", "employer", "education", "skills", "career"],
    "interests": ["hobbies", "sports", "entertainment", "food", "travel"],
    "health": ["allergies", "diet", "conditions", "medications"],
    "relationships": ["family", "friends", "partners", "pets"],
    "preferences": ["likes", "dislikes", "preferences", "favorites"],
    "goals": ["aspirations", "plans", "objectives"],
    "schedule": ["routines", "availability", "commitments"]
}

# Function to add personal information with appropriate metadata
def add_personal_fact(memory_instance, fact, user_id, subcategory=None):
    """Add a personal fact with appropriate metadata categorization
    
    Args:
        memory_instance: Memory instance
        fact: The personal fact to add
        user_id: User identifier
        subcategory: Specific subcategory (optional, will be auto-detected if not provided)
    """
    # Auto-detect category and subcategory if not provided
    if subcategory is None:
        subcategory = determine_subcategory(fact, PERSONAL_CATEGORIES)
    
    # Determine main category from subcategory
    main_category = next(
        (cat for cat, subcats in PERSONAL_CATEGORIES.items() if subcategory in subcats),
        "general"
    )
    
    # Add with appropriate metadata
    result = memory_instance.add(
        fact,
        user_id=user_id,
        metadata={
            "fact_type": "personal",
            "category": main_category,
            "subcategory": subcategory,
            "source": "explicit_statement"
        }
    )
    
    return result

# Helper function to determine subcategory based on content
def determine_subcategory(fact, categories_dict):
    """Determine the most likely subcategory for a personal fact"""
    # Simple keyword matching (in a real app, you might use NLP or the LLM)
    fact_lower = fact.lower()
    
    # Check each subcategory's keywords
    for category, subcategories in categories_dict.items():
        for subcategory in subcategories:
            if subcategory in fact_lower:
                return subcategory
    
    # Default to "general" if no match found
    return "general"

# Example usage
add_personal_fact(
    memory,
    "User is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts",
    "user-123",
    subcategory="allergies"
)

add_personal_fact(
    memory,
    "User enjoys watching science fiction movies on weekends",
    "user-123"
)
```

### Confidence and Source Tracking

Track the confidence and source of personal facts:

```python
def add_verified_personal_fact(memory_instance, fact, user_id, confidence=1.0, source=None):
    """Add a personal fact with confidence and source tracking
    
    Args:
        memory_instance: Memory instance
        fact: The personal fact
        user_id: User identifier
        confidence: Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
        source: Source of information
    """
    # Determine category automatically
    subcategory = determine_subcategory(fact, PERSONAL_CATEGORIES)
    
    # Source classification
    if source is None:
        if "mentioned" in fact.lower() or "stated" in fact.lower():
            source = "explicit_statement"
        elif "seems to" in fact.lower() or "probably" in fact.lower():
            source = "inference" 
            confidence = min(confidence, 0.8)  # Cap confidence for inferences
        else:
            source = "unspecified"
    
    # Add fact with detailed metadata
    result = memory_instance.add(
        fact,
        user_id=user_id,
        metadata={
            "fact_type": "personal",
            "subcategory": subcategory,
            "confidence": confidence,
            "source": source,
            "verified": confidence > 0.9,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    )
    
    return result

# Example usage - explicit statements (high confidence)
add_verified_personal_fact(
    memory,
    "User stated they are lactose intolerant",
    "user-123",
    confidence=0.98,
    source="explicit_statement"
)

# Example usage - inference (lower confidence)
add_verified_personal_fact(
    memory,
    "User seems to prefer texting over phone calls",
    "user-123",
    confidence=0.7,
    source="inference"
)
```

## Retrieving Personal Facts

### Basic Personal Fact Retrieval

To retrieve specific personal information:

```python
# Search for specific personal information
allergies = memory.search(
    "What allergies does the user have?",
    user_id="user-123",
    filters={
        "metadata.subcategory": "allergies"
    }
)

# Get all personal preferences
preferences = memory.search(
    "What are the user's preferences?",
    user_id="user-123",
    filters={
        "metadata.category": "preferences"
    }
)

# Filter by confidence level (only high-confidence facts)
verified_facts = memory.search(
    "What do we know for certain about the user?",
    user_id="user-123",
    filters={
        "metadata.confidence": {"$gte": 0.9}
    }
)
```

### Creating Personal Profiles

Combine personal facts into a comprehensive profile:

```python
def generate_user_profile(memory_instance, user_id):
    """Generate a comprehensive profile of a user from stored memories
    
    Args:
        memory_instance: Memory instance
        user_id: User identifier
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing organized personal information
    """
    # Initialize profile structure
    profile = {
        "identity": {},
        "professional": {},
        "interests": [],
        "health": [],
        "relationships": [],
        "preferences": [],
        "goals": [],
        "schedule": []
    }
    
    # Get all facts about this user
    all_facts = memory_instance.get_all(user_id=user_id)
    
    # Classify and organize facts
    for fact in all_facts["results"]:
        # Skip if not personal fact type
        if not fact.get("metadata") or fact["metadata"].get("fact_type") != "personal":
            continue
            
        category = fact["metadata"].get("category", "general")
        content = fact["memory"]
        confidence = fact["metadata"].get("confidence", 0.5)
        
        # Handle identity and professional as key-value pairs
        if category in ["identity", "professional"]:
            subcategory = fact["metadata"].get("subcategory")
            if subcategory:
                profile[category][subcategory] = {
                    "value": content,
                    "confidence": confidence
                }
        # Handle other categories as lists
        elif category in profile:
            profile[category].append({
                "fact": content,
                "confidence": confidence,
                "subcategory": fact["metadata"].get("subcategory")
            })
    
    return profile

# Generate and use a user profile
user_profile = generate_user_profile(memory, "user-123")
print(f"User identity: {user_profile['identity']}")
print(f"User interests: {user_profile['interests']}")
```

### Temporal Personal Facts

Track how personal facts change over time:

```python
def track_personal_fact_changes(memory_instance, user_id, fact_type):
    """Track changes to a specific type of personal fact over time
    
    Args:
        memory_instance: Memory instance
        user_id: User identifier
        fact_type: Type of fact to track (e.g., "location", "job")
        
    Returns:
        List of changes to this fact type, sorted by date
    """
    # Get facts of this type
    facts = memory_instance.search(
        f"User {fact_type}",
        user_id=user_id,
        filters={
            "metadata.subcategory": fact_type
        }
    )
    
    changes = []
    
    # Examine each fact and its history
    for fact in facts["results"]:
        memory_id = fact["id"]
        history = memory_instance.history(memory_id)
        
        # Extract changes from history
        for entry in history:
            changes.append({
                "date": entry["created_at"] or entry["updated_at"],
                "type": entry["action"],
                "previous": entry["previous_value"],
                "new": entry["new_value"],
                "fact_type": fact_type
            })
    
    # Sort by date
    changes.sort(key=lambda x: x["date"])
    
    return changes

# Example: Track how a user's location has changed
location_changes = track_personal_fact_changes(memory, "user-123", "location")
```

## Advanced Personal Fact Operations

### Resolving Contradictory Information

Handle conflicting personal information:

```python
def resolve_contradictory_facts(memory_instance, user_id, subcategory):
    """Identify and resolve contradictory facts about a person
    
    Args:
        memory_instance: Memory instance
        user_id: User identifier
        subcategory: Specific subcategory to check
        
    Returns:
        Resolved fact (highest confidence or most recent)
    """
    # Get all facts in this subcategory
    facts = memory_instance.search(
        f"User {subcategory}",
        user_id=user_id,
        filters={
            "metadata.subcategory": subcategory
        }
    )
    
    if not facts["results"]:
        return None
        
    # If only one fact, no contradiction
    if len(facts["results"]) == 1:
        return facts["results"][0]
    
    # Multiple facts - potential contradiction
    # Sort by confidence (highest first)
    sorted_by_confidence = sorted(
        facts["results"], 
        key=lambda x: x.get("metadata", {}).get("confidence", 0),
        reverse=True
    )
    
    # Sort by recency (most recent first)
    sorted_by_recency = sorted(
        facts["results"],
        key=lambda x: x.get("created_at") or x.get("updated_at") or "",
        reverse=True
    )
    
    # Choose most confident fact that is also reasonably recent
    # (within 90 days of most recent fact)
    most_recent_date = sorted_by_recency[0].get("created_at") or sorted_by_recency[0].get("updated_at")
    
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from dateutil import parser
    
    if most_recent_date:
        most_recent = parser.parse(most_recent_date)
        recency_threshold = most_recent - timedelta(days=90)
        
        # Filter by recency
        recent_facts = [
            f for f in sorted_by_confidence
            if parser.parse(f.get("created_at") or f.get("updated_at") or most_recent_date) >= recency_threshold
        ]
        
        if recent_facts:
            return recent_facts[0]  # Most confident among recent facts
    
    # Default to most confident if dates can't be parsed
    return sorted_by_confidence[0]

# Example: Resolve potentially contradictory location information
current_location = resolve_contradictory_facts(memory, "user-123", "location")
```

### Using Personal Facts with Graph Memory

Leverage graph memory to track relationships between personal facts:

```python
from mem0 import Memory, MemoryConfig

# Configure with graph memory
config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "personal_facts",
            "embedding_model_dims": 1536
        }
    },
    "graph_store": {
        "provider": "neo4j",
        "config": {
            "url": "bolt://localhost:7687",
            "username": "neo4j",
            "password": "password"
        }
    },
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
        }
    },
    "version": "v1.1"
}

memory = Memory.from_config(config)

# Add information that will create graph relationships
memory.add(
    "Jane is married to Michael. They have two children named Emma and Liam. Jane works at Microsoft as a Product Manager.",
    user_id="jane-user-789"
)

# The graph will automatically capture relationships like:
# - Jane (Person) is married to (relationship) Michael (Person)
# - Jane (Person) has children (relationship) Emma, Liam (Person)
# - Jane (Person) works at (relationship) Microsoft (Organization)
# - Jane (Person) has role (relationship) Product Manager (Role)

# Retrieve relationship information
family_info = memory.search(
    "Who is in Jane's family?",
    user_id="jane-user-789"
)

# Access graph relationships directly
relationships = memory.graph.search(
    "Jane",
    {"user_id": "jane-user-789"}
)
```

## Best Practices for Personal Fact Extraction

1. **Obtain consent**: Always inform users that personal information will be stored

2. **Categorize systematically**: Use consistent categorization for personal facts

3. **Track confidence and source**: Distinguish between explicit statements and inferences

4. **Focus on relevance**: Only extract personal facts that are relevant to your application

5. **Update regularly**: Personal facts can change over time

6. **Handle contradictions**: Implement strategies to resolve conflicting information

7. **Respect privacy**: Be cautious with sensitive personal information

8. **Document your schema**: Maintain clear documentation of your personal fact schema

## Example: Personal Assistant Application

Here's how to use personal fact extraction in a personal assistant application:

```python
from mem0 import Memory
import os

# Initialize memory
memory = Memory()

# Function to provide personalized responses
def personalized_assistant(user_id, query):
    """
    Respond to user queries with personalization based on memory
    
    Args:
        user_id: User identifier
        query: User's question or request
        
    Returns:
        Personalized response based on memory
    """
    # Retrieve relevant memories for this user
    relevant_memories = memory.search(query, user_id=user_id)
    
    # Format memories for context
    memory_context = ""
    if relevant_memories["results"]:
        memory_context = "Information about the user:\n" + "\n".join(
            [f"- {mem['memory']}" for mem in relevant_memories["results"]]
        )
    
    # Generate response using memories
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": f"You are a personal assistant for this user. {memory_context}"},
        {"role": "user", "content": query}
    ]
    
    response = memory.llm.generate_response(messages=messages)
    
    # Store this interaction
    memory.add(
        [
            {"role": "user", "content": query},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": response}
        ],
        user_id=user_id
    )
    
    return response

# Example usage
response = personalized_assistant(
    "user-123",
    "What should I eat for dinner tonight?"
)
print(response)  # Will consider allergies, preferences, etc. from memory
```

## Conclusion

Effective personal fact extraction and management is essential for building truly personalized AI applications. By following the approaches outlined in this guide, you can create systems that understand and remember important details about users, enabling more natural and contextually appropriate interactions.
