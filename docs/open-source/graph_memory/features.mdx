config = {
    "graph_store": {
        "provider": "neo4j",
        "config": {
            "url": "neo4j+s://xxx",
            "username": "neo4j",
            "password": "xxx"
        },
        "custom_prompt": "Please only extract entities containing sports related relationships and nothing else.",
    },
