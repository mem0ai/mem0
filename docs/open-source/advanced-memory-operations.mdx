# Advanced Memory Operations

This guide covers advanced usage of the mem0 Python API, focusing on graph memory, metadata management, and sophisticated memory operations.

## Memory System Architecture

The mem0 memory system consists of two primary components:

1. **Vector Memory Storage**: Stores memory content with embeddings for semantic search
2. **Graph Memory Storage**: Tracks relationships between entities for contextual retrieval

These components work together to provide a comprehensive memory system that can:
- Store and retrieve facts semantically
- Maintain relationships between entities
- Track changes to memory over time
- Manage metadata and categorization

## Advanced Memory Configuration

### Graph Memory Configuration

Graph memory requires configuration of both vector store and graph store components:

```python
from mem0 import Memory, MemoryConfig

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "my_memories",
            "embedding_model_dims": 1536
        }
    },
    "graph_store": {
        "provider": "neo4j",
        "config": {
            "url": "bolt://localhost:7687",
            "username": "neo4j",
            "password": "password"
        }
    },
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
        }
    },
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "gpt-4o"
        }
    },
    "version": "v1.1"  # Required for advanced features
}

memory = Memory.from_config(config)
```

### Custom Fact Extraction and Processing

For advanced memory operations, you can customize how facts are extracted and processed:

```python
config = MemoryConfig(
    custom_fact_extraction_prompt="You are extracting facts about a person. Focus on their preferences, background, and relationships. Extract detailed facts that would be useful for personalization.",
    custom_update_memory_prompt="You are updating a knowledge base about a person. Focus on resolving conflicts between old and new information, prioritizing recent information when appropriate."
)

memory = Memory(config)
```

## Working with Graph Memory

Graph memory automatically extracts entities and their relationships, creating a knowledge graph that enhances memory retrieval.

### Adding Memories with Graph Analysis

When adding memories with graph memory enabled, mem0 extracts entities and relationships:

```python
# Add a memory that will create graph relationships
result = memory.add(
    "John graduated from Stanford University in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. He now works at Google as a Senior Software Engineer.",
    user_id="john-doe",
)

# The result contains both vector memories and graph relationships
print(f"Vector memories: {result['results']}")
print(f"Graph relations: {result['relations']}")
```

The relations output will show connections like:
- Person "John" → (graduated from) → Organization "Stanford University"
- Person "John" → (has degree in) → Field "Computer Science"
- Person "John" → (works at) → Organization "Google"
- Person "John" → (has position) → Role "Senior Software Engineer"

### Searching with Graph Context

Graph memory enhances search by considering relationships between entities:

```python
# Search with consideration of graph relationships
result = memory.search(
    "Where did John study?", 
    user_id="john-doe"
)

# Results will include both direct matches and context from relations
print(result['results'])    # Vector memory matches
print(result['relations'])  # Related graph connections
```

### Working with the Graph Memory API Directly

For advanced operations, you can interact with the graph memory system directly:

```python
# Access the graph memory component
graph = memory.graph

# Get all graph entities and relationships
entities_and_relations = graph.get_all({"user_id": "john-doe"})

# Search for specific entities or relationships
education_info = graph.search("education", {"user_id": "john-doe"})

# Delete graph data
graph.delete_all({"user_id": "john-doe"})
```

## Advanced Metadata Management

Mem0 supports rich metadata attachments to memories, which can be used for filtering, categorization, and context.

### Adding Custom Metadata

Attach arbitrary metadata to memories for organization and filtering:

```python
memory.add(
    "I prefer dark mode interfaces and use vim keybindings in my code editor.",
    user_id="user-123",
    metadata={
        "category": "preferences",
        "topics": ["ui", "tools", "development"],
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "source": "explicit_statement",
        "context": {
            "session_id": "abc-123",
            "platform": "desktop",
            "application": "code_editor_survey"
        }
    }
)
```

### Filtering by Metadata

Use metadata for targeted memory retrieval:

```python
# Search with metadata filters
ui_preferences = memory.search(
    "What UI preferences does the user have?",
    user_id="user-123",
    filters={
        "metadata.category": "preferences",
        "metadata.topics": "ui"
    }
)
```

### Working with Timestamps

All memories automatically include created_at and updated_at timestamps, which you can use for time-based operations:

```python
# Retrieving memories and using timestamp information
memories = memory.get_all(user_id="user-123")

for mem in memories['results']:
    created = mem.get('created_at')
    updated = mem.get('updated_at')
    print(f"Memory: {mem.get('memory')}")
    print(f"Created: {created}")
    print(f"Last updated: {updated or 'Never updated'}")
    
    # Calculate how old the memory is
    if created:
        from datetime import datetime
        import pytz
        
        created_datetime = datetime.fromisoformat(created)
        now = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
        age = now - created_datetime
        print(f"Memory age: {age.days} days")
```

## Memory History and Change Tracking

Mem0 automatically tracks the history of all memory changes, allowing you to see how information evolves over time.

### Retrieving Memory History

Track the evolution of specific memories:

```python
# Get a memory's complete history
memory_id = "memory-uuid-here"
history = memory.history(memory_id)

# Display the evolution of this memory
for change in history:
    print(f"Action: {change['action']}")
    print(f"Timestamp: {change['created_at']}")
    print(f"Previous value: {change['previous_value'] or 'None (new memory)'}")
    print(f"New value: {change['new_value']}")
    print("---")
```

### Working with Memory Types

Mem0 supports different memory types, including special handling for procedural memories (how-to knowledge):

```python
# Create a procedural memory from a conversation about a process
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do I make cold brew coffee?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "To make cold brew coffee:\n1. Coarsely grind coffee beans\n2. Mix 1 part coffee with 4 parts cold water\n3. Steep for 12-24 hours at room temperature\n4. Strain the grounds\n5. Dilute with water or milk to taste\n6. Serve over ice"}
]

procedural_memory = memory.add(
    conversation,
    user_id="coffee-lover",
    agent_id="coffee-expert",  # Required for procedural memory
    memory_type="procedural_memory"
)
```

## Memory Batch Operations

For efficient handling of multiple memories, mem0 provides batch operations:

### Memory Export

Export all memories for backup or analysis:

```python
# Get all memories for a user with complete metadata
all_memories = memory.get_all(user_id="user-123")

# Process memories for export
import json
with open("memory_export.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(all_memories, f, indent=2)
```

### Bulk Memory Management

Reset or clear memories selectively:

```python
# Delete all memories for a specific user
memory.delete_all(user_id="user-123")

# Delete all memories for a specific agent
memory.delete_all(agent_id="agent-456")

# Reset the entire memory system (use with caution)
memory.reset()
```

## Combining Vector and Graph Memory

For complex applications, you can leverage both vector and graph memory together:

```python
def comprehensive_memory_retrieval(query, user_id):
    """
    Perform a comprehensive memory search using both vector and graph memory
    
    Args:
        query: Search query string
        user_id: User identifier
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing combined and processed results
    """
    # Get semantic matches from vector storage
    vector_results = memory.search(query, user_id=user_id)
    
    # Extract key entities from the results
    entities = []
    for result in vector_results['results']:
        # Simple entity extraction for demonstration
        entities.extend([word for word in result['memory'].split() if word[0].isupper()])
    
    # Use graph memory to find relationships for these entities
    graph_results = []
    if memory.enable_graph:
        for entity in entities:
            graph_results.extend(memory.graph.search(entity, {"user_id": user_id}))
    
    # Combine and process results
    combined_results = {
        "vector_matches": vector_results,
        "related_entities": graph_results,
        "query": query
    }
    
    return combined_results
```

## Integrating with LLM Tools

Mem0 can be used as a tool for language models, enabling them to read and write memories:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()

def memory_tool(user_id, action, **kwargs):
    """
    Function that allows an LLM to interact with memory
    
    Args:
        user_id: User identifier
        action: "add", "search", or "get"
        **kwargs: Additional parameters for the action
    """
    if action == "add":
        result = memory.add(kwargs.get("content"), user_id=user_id)
        return f"Memory added successfully: {json.dumps(result)}"
    
    elif action == "search":
        result = memory.search(kwargs.get("query"), user_id=user_id)
        memories = [item['memory'] for item in result['results']]
        return f"Found memories: {json.dumps(memories)}"
    
    elif action == "get":
        result = memory.get_all(user_id=user_id)
        memories = [item['memory'] for item in result['results']]
        return f"All memories: {json.dumps(memories)}"
    
    return "Invalid action. Supported actions: add, search, get"

# Define the tool for the LLM
memory_tool_description = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "memory_tool",
        "description": "Store or retrieve memories for a user",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "user_id": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The user ID to store or retrieve memories for"
                },
                "action": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["add", "search", "get"],
                    "description": "The action to perform: add, search, or get memories"
                },
                "content": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "For add action: The content to store in memory"
                },
                "query": {
                    "type": "string", 
                    "description": "For search action: The query to search for in memories"
                }
            },
            "required": ["user_id", "action"]
        }
    }
}

# Use with an LLM
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant with the ability to store and retrieve memories."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Remember that I have a dog named Max who's a Golden Retriever."}
    ],
    tools=[memory_tool_description]
)
```

## Performance Optimization

For high-performance applications, consider these optimization techniques:

### Connection Pooling

For production deployments with Neo4j graph storage:

```python
config = {
    "graph_store": {
        "provider": "neo4j",
        "config": {
            "url": "bolt://localhost:7687",
            "username": "neo4j",
            "password": "password",
            "max_connection_pool_size": 50,  # Adjust based on expected load
            "connection_acquisition_timeout": 60  # Seconds
        }
    }
}
```

### Embedding Caching

Implement caching for embeddings to reduce API calls:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class CachedEmbedder:
    def __init__(self, embedder):
        self.embedder = embedder
        
    @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
    def cached_embed(self, text, action):
        return self.embedder.embed(text, action)
        
    def embed(self, text, action):
        return self.cached_embed(text, action)

# Apply the cache wrapper
memory.embedding_model = CachedEmbedder(memory.embedding_model)
```

## Debugging Memory Operations

For developing and debugging memory applications:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Test memory add/retrieval cycle
test_message = "I prefer to work from 8am to 4pm and take a lunch break at noon."
add_result = memory.add(test_message, user_id="test-user")
print(f"Added memory IDs: {[m['id'] for m in add_result['results']]}")

# Verify retrieval
search_result = memory.search("work schedule", user_id="test-user")
print(f"Retrieved memories: {[m['memory'] for m in search_result['results']]}")

# Check history tracking is working
for mem_id in [m['id'] for m in add_result['results']]:
    history = memory.history(mem_id)
    print(f"Memory {mem_id} history: {len(history)} entries")
```

## Conclusion

The mem0 memory system provides a versatile foundation for building AI applications with persistent, contextual memory. By leveraging both vector and graph storage capabilities along with rich metadata, you can create sophisticated applications that maintain contextual awareness and personalization over time.
