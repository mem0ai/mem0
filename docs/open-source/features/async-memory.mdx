## AsyncMemory

The `AsyncMemory` class is a direct asynchronous interface to Mem0's in-process memory operations. Unlike the memory, which interacts with an API, `AsyncMemory` works directly with the underlying storage systems. This makes it ideal for applications where you want to embed Mem0 directly into your codebase.

### Initialization

To use `AsyncMemory`, import it from the `mem0.memory` module:

```python Python
import asyncio
from mem0.memory import AsyncMemory

# Initialize with default configuration
memory = AsyncMemory()

# Or initialize with custom configuration
from mem0.configs.base import MemoryConfig
custom_config = MemoryConfig(
    # Your custom configuration here
)
memory = AsyncMemory(config=custom_config)
```

### Key Features

1. **Non-blocking Operations** - All memory operations use `asyncio` to avoid blocking the event loop
2. **Concurrent Processing** - Parallel execution of vector store and graph operations
3. **Efficient Resource Utilization** - Better handling of I/O bound operations
4. **Compatible with Async Frameworks** - Seamless integration with FastAPI, aiohttp, and other async frameworks

### Methods

All methods in `AsyncMemory` have the same parameters as the synchronous `Memory` class but are designed to be used with `async/await`.

#### Add

Add a new memory asynchronously:

```python Python
await memory.add(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "I'm travelling to SF"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's great to hear!"}
    ],
    user_id="alice"
)
```

#### Search

Search for specific memories:

```python Python
await memory.search(
    query="Where am I travelling?",
    user_id="alice"
)
```

#### Get All

Retrieve all memories for a user:

```python Python
await memory.get_all(user_id="alice")
```

#### Get

Retrieve a specific memory by its ID:

```python Python
await memory.get(memory_id="memory-id-here")
```

#### Update

Update an existing memory by ID:

```python Python
await memory.update(
    memory_id="memory-id-here",
    data="I'm travelling to Seattle"
)
```

#### Delete

Delete a specific memory by ID:

```python Python
await memory.delete(memory_id="memory-id-here")
```

#### Delete All

Delete all memories for a specific user, agent, or run:

```python Python
await memory.delete_all(user_id="alice")
```

Note: At least one filter (user_id, agent_id, or run_id) is required when using delete_all.

#### Memory History

Get the history of changes for a specific memory:

```python Python
await memory.history(memory_id="memory-id-here")
```

### Example: Concurrent Usage with Other APIs

`AsyncMemory` can be effectively combined with other async operations. Here's an example showing how to use it alongside OpenAI API calls in separate threads:

```python Python
import asyncio
import threading
import openai
from mem0.memory import AsyncMemory

# Helper function to run async code in a thread
def run_async_in_thread(async_func, *args, **kwargs):
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    result = loop.run_until_complete(async_func(*args, **kwargs))
    loop.close()
    return result

# Async function for memory operations
async def add_and_retrieve_memory(content, user_id):
    memory = AsyncMemory()
    
    # Add the memory
    await memory.add(messages=content, user_id=user_id)
    
    # Wait briefly for processing
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    # Retrieve and return memories
    return await memory.get_all(user_id=user_id)

def main():
    # Make OpenAI API call in main thread
    openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short paragraph about AI"}]
    )
    content = response.choices[0].message.content
    print(f"Generated content: {content}")
    
    # Start memory operations in a separate thread
    memory_thread = threading.Thread(
        target=run_async_in_thread,
        args=(add_and_retrieve_memory, content, "alice")
    )
    memory_thread.start()
    
    # Continue with other work in main thread...
    
    # Wait for memory operations to complete
    memory_thread.join()
    print("Memory operations completed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
