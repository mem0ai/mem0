title: REST API Server
description: Reach every Mem0 OSS capability through a FastAPI-powered REST layer.
icon: "code"
---

The Mem0 REST API server exposes every OSS memory operation over HTTP. Run it alongside your stack to add, search, update, and delete memories from any language that speaks REST.

<Info>
  **You’ll use this when…**
  - Your services already talk to REST APIs and you want Mem0 to match that style.
  - Teams on languages without the Mem0 SDK still need access to memories.
  - You plan to explore or debug endpoints through the built-in OpenAPI page at `/docs`.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Add your own authentication and HTTPS before exposing the server to anything beyond your internal network. The default image does not include auth.
</Warning>

---

## Feature

- **CRUD endpoints:** Create, retrieve, search, update, delete, and reset memories by `user_id`, `agent_id`, or `run_id`.
- **Status health check:** Access base routes to confirm the server is online.
- **OpenAPI explorer:** Visit `/docs` for interactive testing and schema reference.

## Configure it

### Run with Docker Compose (development)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Steps">
1. Create `server/.env` with your keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

2. Start the stack:

```bash
cd server
docker compose up
```

3. Reach the API at `http://localhost:8888`. Edits to the server or library auto-reload.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run with Docker

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pull image">
```bash
docker pull mem0/mem0-api-server
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build locally">
```bash
docker build -t mem0-api-server .
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

1. Create a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.  
2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env mem0-api-server
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

### Run directly (no Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

<Tip>
  Use a process manager such as `systemd`, Supervisor, or PM2 when deploying the FastAPI server for production resilience.
</Tip>

<Note>
  The REST server reads the same configuration you use locally, so you can point it at your preferred LLM, vector store, graph backend, and reranker without changing code.
</Note>

## See it in action

### Create and search memories via HTTP

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "I love fresh vegetable pizza."}
    ],
    "user_id": "alice"
  }'
```

<Info icon="check">
  Expect a JSON response containing the new memory IDs and events (`ADD`, etc.).
</Info>

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/memories/search?user_id=alice&query=vegetable"
```

### Explore with OpenAPI docs

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.  
2. Pick an endpoint (e.g., `POST /memories/search`).  
3. Fill in parameters and click **Execute** to try requests in-browser.

<Tip>
  Export the generated `curl` snippets from the OpenAPI UI to bootstrap integration tests.
</Tip>

## Verify the feature is working

- Hit the root route and `/docs` to confirm the server is reachable.
- Run a full cycle: `POST /memories` → `GET /memories/{id}` → `DELETE /memories/{id}`.
- Watch server logs for import errors or provider misconfigurations during startup.
- Confirm environment variables (API keys, vector store credentials) load correctly when containers restart.

---

## Best practices

1. **Add authentication:** Protect endpoints with API gateways, proxies, or custom FastAPI middleware.
2. **Use HTTPS:** Terminate TLS at your load balancer or reverse proxy.
3. **Monitor uptime:** Track request rates, latency, and error codes per endpoint.
4. **Version configs:** Keep environment files and Docker Compose definitions in source control.
5. **Limit exposure:** Bind to private networks unless you explicitly need public access.
