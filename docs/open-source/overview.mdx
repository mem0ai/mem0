# Mem0 Open Source Overview

Mem0 Open Source delivers the same adaptive memory engine as the platform, but packaged for teams that need to run everything on their own infrastructure. You own the stack, the data, and the customizations.

<Tip>
  Mem0 v1.0.0 brought rerankers, async-by-default clients, and Azure OpenAI support. See the <Link href="/changelog">release notes</Link> for the full rundown before upgrading.
</Tip>

## What Mem0 OSS provides

- **Full control**: Tune every component, from LLMs to vector stores, inside your environment.
- **Offline ready**: Keep memory on your own network when compliance or privacy demands it.
- **Extendable codebase**: Fork the repo, add providers, and ship custom automations.

<Info>
  Begin with the <Link href="/open-source/python-quickstart">Python quickstart</Link> (or the Node.js variant) to clone the repo, configure dependencies, and validate memory reads/writes locally.

## Default components

<Note>
  Mem0 OSS works out of the box with sensible defaults:
  - LLM: OpenAI `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` (via `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  - Embeddings: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
  - Vector store: Local Qdrant instance storing data at `/tmp/qdrant`
  - History store: SQLite database at `~/.mem0/history.db`
  - Reranker: Disabled until you configure a provider

  Override any component with <Link href="/open-source/configuration">`Memory.from_config`</Link>.
