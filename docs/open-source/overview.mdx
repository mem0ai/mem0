## Default Components

<Note>
**No configuration needed to get started.** Mem0 works out of the box with sensible defaults:

- **LLM**: OpenAI `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` via your `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)
- **Vector store**: Local Qdrant instance storing data at `/tmp/qdrant`
- **History storage**: SQLite database at `~/.mem0/history.db`
- **Reranker**: Disabled unless you configure one

Override any component with [`Memory.from_config`](/open-source/configuration).
