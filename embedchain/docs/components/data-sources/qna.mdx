title: '‚ùìüí¨ Question and answer pair'
---

## Overview

The `qna_pair` is a **local data source type** that allows you to provide custom question-and-answer content directly into your Embedchain app. This is especially useful when you want to inject targeted knowledge without relying on external files, websites, or APIs.

## Format

The `value` must be a **Python tuple containing exactly two strings**:

- The first string is the **question**
- The second string is the **answer**

Example:
```python
("What is the capital of France?", "The capital of France is Paris.")
