# Mem0 Self-Hosted Server

Mem0 ships a self-hosted FastAPI server plus a local dashboard. It is secure by default, supports dashboard login and API keys, and exposes OpenAPI docs at `/docs`.

## Quick Start

### Agent-first

```bash
cd server
make bootstrap
```

This starts the stack, waits for the API and dashboard to be ready, creates the first admin, and generates the first API key.

You can override the generated credentials:

```bash
cd server
make bootstrap EMAIL=admin@company.com PASSWORD='strong-password' NAME='Admin'
```

For machine-readable output:

```bash
cd server
OUTPUT=json make seed
```

### Browser-first

```bash
cd server
make up
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` and complete the setup wizard.

## Security Defaults

- Dashboard login uses JWTs.
- Programmatic access uses `X-API-Key`.
- Auth is enabled by default.
- `AUTH_DISABLED=true` exists for local development only and should not be used in production.

## Local URLs

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
- API: `http://localhost:8888`
- OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8888/docs`

## Dashboard

Once logged in, the dashboard exposes:

- **Requests** — live audit log of API calls (method, path, status, latency).
- **Memories** — browse memories, filter by user ID.
- **Entities** — list every `user_id`, `agent_id`, and `run_id` that owns memories, with counts. Delete an entity to cascade-delete its memories.
- **API Keys** — create, label, and revoke per-user keys.
- **Configuration** — runtime LLM and embedder override. Changes apply to the running process and reset on restart; edit `.env` to persist.
- **Settings** — account profile and password.
