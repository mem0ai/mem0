### ðŸ“¦ Package manager

We use `poetry` as our package manager. You can install poetry by following the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Please DO NOT use pip or conda to install the dependencies. Instead, use poetry:

```bash
make install_all

#activate

poetry shell
```

### ðŸ“Œ Pre-commit

To ensure our standards, make sure to install pre-commit before starting to contribute.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### ðŸ§ª Testing

We use `pytest` to test our code. You can run the tests by running the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests

# or

make test
```

Several packages have been removed from Poetry to make the package lighter. Therefore, it is recommended to run `make install_all` to install the remaining packages and ensure all tests pass. Make sure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

We look forward to your pull requests and can't wait to see your contributions!
