DEFAULT_UPDATE_MEMORY_PROMPT = """You are a smart memory manager which controls the memory of a system.
You can perform four operations: (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory, and (4) no change.

Based on the above four operations, the memory will change.

Compare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each new fact, decide whether to:
- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element
- UPDATE: Update an existing memory element
- DELETE: Delete an existing memory element
- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)

There are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:

1. **Add**: If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "User is a software engineer"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Name is John"]
    - New Memory:
        {
            "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "User is a software engineer",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "ADD"
                }
            ]

        }

2. **Update**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. 
If the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information. 
Example (a) -- if the memory contains "User likes to play cricket" and the retrieved fact is "Loves to play cricket with friends", then update the memory with the retrieved facts.
Example (b) -- if the memory contains "Likes cheese pizza" and the retrieved fact is "Loves cheese pizza", then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.
If the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.
Please keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "I really like cheese pizza"

                }
            ]
        }


3. **Delete**: If the retrieved facts contain information that contradicts the information present in the memory, then you have to delete it. Or if the direction is to delete the memory, then you have to delete it.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [

                }
        ]
        }

4. **No Change**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory, then you do not need to make any changes.

PROCEDURAL_MEMORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a memory summarization system that records and preserves the complete interaction history between a human and an AI agent. You are provided with the agent’s execution history over the past N steps. Your task is to produce a comprehensive summary of the agent's output history that contains every detail necessary for the agent to continue the task without ambiguity. **Every output produced by the agent must be recorded verbatim as part of the summary.**

### Overall Structure:
- **Overview (Global Metadata):**
  - **Task Objective**: The overall goal the agent is working to accomplish.
  - **Progress Status**: The current completion percentage and summary of specific milestones or steps completed.

- **Sequential Agent Actions (Numbered Steps):**
  Each numbered step must be a self-contained entry that includes all of the following elements:

  1. **Agent Action**:
     - Precisely describe what the agent did (e.g., "Clicked on the 'Blog' link", "Called API to fetch content", "Scraped page data").
     - Include all parameters, target elements, or methods involved.

  2. **Action Result (Mandatory, Unmodified)**:
     - Immediately follow the agent action with its exact, unaltered output.
     - Record all returned data, responses, HTML snippets, JSON content, or error messages exactly as received. This is critical for constructing the final output later.

  3. **Embedded Metadata**:
     For the same numbered step, include additional context such as:
     - **Key Findings**: Any important information discovered (e.g., URLs, data points, search results).
     - **Navigation History**: For browser agents, detail which pages were visited, including their URLs and relevance.
     - **Errors & Challenges**: Document any error messages, exceptions, or challenges encountered along with any attempted recovery or troubleshooting.
     - **Current Context**: Describe the state after the action (e.g., "Agent is on the blog detail page" or "JSON data stored for further processing") and what the agent plans to do next.

### Guidelines:
1. **Preserve Every Output**: The exact output of each agent action is essential. Do not paraphrase or summarize the output. It must be stored as is for later use.
2. **Chronological Order**: Number the agent actions sequentially in the order they occurred. Each numbered step is a complete record of that action.
3. **Detail and Precision**:
   - Use exact data: Include URLs, element indexes, error messages, JSON responses, and any other concrete values.
   - Preserve numeric counts and metrics (e.g., "3 out of 5 items processed").
   - For any errors, include the full error message and, if applicable, the stack trace or cause.
4. **Output Only the Summary**: The final output must consist solely of the structured summary with no additional commentary or preamble.

### Example Template:

```
## Summary of the agent's execution history

**Task Objective**: Scrape blog post titles and full content from the OpenAI blog.
**Progress Status**: 10% complete — 5 out of 50 blog posts processed.

   **Key Findings**: Blog listing shows 10 blog previews.  
   **Navigation History**: Transitioned from homepage to blog listing page.  
   **Current Context**: Blog listing page displayed.

3. **Agent Action**: Extracted the first 5 blog post links from the blog listing page.  
   **Action Result**:  
      "[ '/blog/chatgpt-updates', '/blog/ai-and-education', '/blog/openai-api-announcement', '/blog/gpt-4-release', '/blog/safety-and-alignment' ]"  
   **Key Findings**: Identified 5 valid blog post URLs.  
   **Current Context**: URLs stored in memory for further processing.

4. **Agent Action**: Visited URL "https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-updates"  
   **Action Result**:  
      "HTML content loaded for the blog post including full article text."  
   **Key Findings**: Extracted blog title "ChatGPT Updates – March 2025" and article content excerpt.  
   **Current Context**: Blog post content extracted and stored.

5. **Agent Action**: Extracted blog title and full article content from "https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-updates"  
   **Action Result**:  
      "{ 'title': 'ChatGPT Updates – March 2025', 'content': 'We\'re introducing new updates to ChatGPT, including improved browsing capabilities and memory recall... (full content)' }"

- **text** (string, optional): A contextually rich, self-contained factual statement. Required for ADD and UPDATE. Omit for DELETE.
- **previous_memory_id** (string, optional): The exact UUID of the Existing Memory being modified. Required for UPDATE and DELETE. Null for ADD.

## Rules
- For each piece of information compared against Existing Memories:
  - If new: use "ADD" with previous_memory_id = null
  - If updating: use "UPDATE" with previous_memory_id = <UUID>
  - If nullifying/contradicting: use "DELETE" with previous_memory_id = <UUID>
- If nothing requires action, return: {"memory": []}
- No duplicate previous_memory_id values. Use double quotes. No trailing commas.

AGENT_CONTEXT_SUFFIX = """

## Entity Context

The primary entity is an AI agent. Frame memories from the agent's perspective:
- For user-stated facts, frame as agent knowledge: "Agent was informed that [fact]" or "Agent learned that [fact]"
- For agent actions, use direct statements: "Agent recommended [X]" or "Agent specializes in [domain]"
- For agent configuration or instructions, capture directly: "Agent is configured to [behavior]"

The attributed_to field should still reflect the original source: "user" for facts the user stated, "assistant" for things the agent said or did.
