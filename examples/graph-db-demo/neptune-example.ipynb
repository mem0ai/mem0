    "### 1. Install Mem0 with Graph Memory support \n",
    "\n",
    "To use Mem0 with Graph Memory support (as well as other Amazon services), use pip install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install \"mem0ai[graph,extras]\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 2. Connect to Amazon services\n",
    "\n",
    "For this sample notebook, configure `mem0ai` with [Amazon Neptune Analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune-analytics/latest/userguide/what-is-neptune-analytics.html) as the graph store, [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-overview.html) as the vector store, and [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) for generating embeddings.\n",
