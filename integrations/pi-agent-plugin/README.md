# @mem0/pi-agent-plugin

Persistent semantic memory for [Pi Agent](https://pi.dev), powered by [Mem0](https://mem0.ai).

This extension gives Pi Agent long-term memory that persists across sessions, projects, and devices. Memories are automatically captured from conversations and can be searched, managed, and consolidated through slash commands and an agent-accessible tool.

## Features

- **Automatic memory capture** — learns from every conversation (both user and assistant messages)
- **Semantic search** — find memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Scoped memory** — project, session, or global scope
- **Monorepo-aware** — uses git root for project detection, consistent app_id across subdirectories
- **Dream consolidation** — merges duplicates, resolves contradictions, prunes stale entries
- **Confirmation dialogs** — destructive commands ask before acting
- **8 slash commands** — essential memory management from the command line
- **Agent tool** — `mem0_memory` tool lets the agent search and store memories autonomously

## Setup

### 1. Get an API key

Sign up at [app.mem0.ai](https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys) and copy your API key.

### 2. Install

```bash
pi install npm:@mem0/pi-agent-plugin
```

### 3. Configure

Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export MEM0_API_KEY="m0-your-key-here"
```

Or create a config file at `~/.pi/agent/mem0-config.json`:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "m0-your-key-here",
  "userId": "your-username",
  "autoCapture": true,
  "defaultScope": "project",
  "searchThreshold": 0.2,
  "dream": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto": true,
    "minHours": 24,
    "minSessions": 5,
    "minMemories": 20
  }
}
```

Environment variables (`MEM0_API_KEY`, `MEM0_USER_ID`) override the config file.

`searchThreshold` (default `0.3`) is the minimum similarity score (0–1) a memory must reach to count as a match for `/mem0-search`, `/mem0-forget`, and `/mem0-pin`. It is passed to the mem0 search API (along with reranking for higher-precision ordering), so a query with no sufficiently similar memory reports no match instead of returning the closest unrelated memories. Raise it to be stricter; lower it if relevant results are missed.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mem0-remember <text>` | Store a memory verbatim (no inference) |
| `/mem0-forget <query>` | Search and delete memories (with confirmation) |
| `/mem0-search <query>` | Semantic search across memories |
| `/mem0-tour [scope]` | Browse all memories grouped by category |
| `/mem0-dream` | Consolidate — merge duplicates, prune stale, resolve contradictions |
| `/mem0-pin <query>` | Pin a memory to protect from dream pruning (preserves ID) |
| `/mem0-scope <scope>` | Change default scope for this session |
| `/mem0-status` | Connection health, identity, and memory count |

## Skills

The plugin includes 8 skills that guide the agent on how to use each capability:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `context-loader` | Pre-fetch relevant memories at session start |
| `remember` | Store facts with category classification |
| `search` | Quick semantic search with compact results |
| `forget` | Delete memories with confirmation |
| `dream` | Memory consolidation workflow |
| `tour` | Full memory walkthrough by category |
| `pin` | Protect critical memories from pruning |
| `status` | Health check and diagnostics |

## Memory Scopes

| Scope | Filters | Use case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `project` | user + app_id (git root) | Default. Project-specific knowledge |
| `session` | user + app_id + run_id | Ephemeral, session-only context |
| `global` | user only | All memories across all your projects |

Project scoping uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to detect the repository root, so all subdirectories within a monorepo share the same memory pool.

## Memory Categories

Memories are automatically classified into 10 general-purpose categories:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `identity` | Personal details, background, self-descriptions |
| `preferences` | Likes, dislikes, habits, preferred approaches |
| `goals` | Objectives, aspirations, targets |
| `projects` | Ongoing work, initiatives, areas of focus |
| `decisions` | Choices made, rationale, trade-offs |
| `technical` | Technical knowledge, tools, configurations |
| `relationships` | People, teams, organizations |
| `routines` | Recurring patterns, workflows, schedules |
| `lessons` | Insights learned, mistakes to avoid |
| `work` | Professional context, role, responsibilities |
